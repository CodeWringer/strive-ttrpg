A role-playing game by Nicolas Haase

# Introduction
**Ambersteel** is a table-top role-playing game (**TTRPG**), requiring a **game master** (**GM**) and at least one **player** to play. 

At its core, **Ambersteel** is about exploring ever-evolving characters through play, by confronting them with challenges to their very beliefs. The system is best suited for long-term games, running over several real-world sessions. One-shots are possible but may not provide the best experience, as several of the system's mechanics require breaks in play. 

On the spectrum of *narrative-driven*, *game-y* and *simulationist*, **Ambersteel** aims for the region between *game-y* and *narrative-driven*, while leaning heavily towards *game-y*. The rules are designed to be as intuitive and simple as possible, while complex enough to enable players making meaningful choices. 

More details about the system:
* Player character evolution is baked into the rules. 
  * Characters have long-term and short-term goals, which drive them onward and which change over time. 
  * There are no classes or other arbitrary restrictions on what a character can do. 
    * **Attributes** and **skills** improve as they are used. 
    * Generalist characters benefit from varied knowledge, while specialists enjoy unique abilities. 
* Role-playing is encouraged by game mechanics. 
  * A meta-currency, called **fate points** is earned by *players*, based on what they and their character do in a session. 
  * Characters can help each other in game mechanical ways, encouraging co-operative play. 
* Combat is a risky affair and requires tactical and strategic thinking, or the readiness to retreat, when things go awry. 
  * When a character suffers **injuries**, they are in *serious trouble*. 
  * Recovery from injuries is expected to take several in-game weeks. 
* Players are expected to manage resources, such as their character's health and assets. Character's are neither *damage sponges*, nor *item vacuums*. 

Extensibility and adaptability form a core foundation of the system. While in its current form it best supports medieval fantasy themes, it should be fairly well adaptable to any theme and setting and even encourages you to do so. The bulk of the work would lie in designing skills and assets that fit your setting's theme and setting.

Most rules will have a certain degree of vagueness to them. This is at least partially deliberate. The situations that can come up during play are simply too varied and numerous to be possible to completely cover with rules, without requiring epic tomes filled to the brim with highly specific rulings for highly specific situations. Instead, the game relies on the **GM** to arbitrate in every situation. The descriptions in the rules here should serve as a point of orientation for the **GM**. How they interpret the rules, is how they're to be understood. 

# How to Play
As **Ambersteel** is a **roleplaying game**, there are certain rules and expectations of both players and **GM**. 

Despite the focus on tactical and deadly combat, this is not an *adversarial* game. The **GM** and the players work ***together*** to create a unique experience and weave a story of glorious triumph, tragic defeat or anything in-between. Ultimately, the **GM**'s job is to provide interesting conundrums to the players and their job is to provide interesting answers, in-line with what their characters believe. What's important to remember is that the **GM** is a *player*, too. They're here to have fun and enjoy their time at the table, as well. 

Each player only directly controls a single character. The **GM** is in control of every single non-player character (**NPC**), the world and the story. A player character is abbreviated as **PC**. 

In some places, where distances are concerned, both feet and meters are noted as units. What attentive readers will notice, is that the conversion between the numbers won't always be correct. This is a deliberate decision to make the math easier, whenever distances are concerned. If a battlemap is used, one square on the grid should represent either a three foot, or one meter square. Furthermore, a single, ordinary human, should occupy an entire such square. 

## Dice
**Ambersteel** uses a **dice pool** system of **six-sided dice** (henceforth referred to as **D6**) to resolve [tests](#tests). *Dice pool* means a variable number of dice will be rolled, based on a character's [attributes](#attributes), [skills](#skills), boons and circumstance of the situation they're in. 

The following types of dice come into play:
* **D2** - a coin
* **D3** - three-sided dice
* **D4** - four-sided dice
* **D5** - five-sided dice
* **D6** - six-sided dice
* **D8** - eight-sided dice
* **D10** (**D100**) - two ten-sided dice

## Before the Game
The very first step of preparing for play, is to decide on a theme, world and setting of the game. Ideally, the players and **GM** decide together, but ultimately, the **GM**'s preferences should a greater weight. When a **GM** isn't really interested in the theme, world and setting, the game will quickly start feeling like work to them. They will lose steam and eventually the will to continue the game. 

Then, still before anyone can start to play, the players have to [create their characters](#character-creation). Ideally, this process should be done in cooperation with the **GM** and each other, to make sure the character concepts fit into the world and planned narrative. Also, it is advisable to design characters that will work well together, as a group. Or, you could plan for a discordant group of PCs, but make sure the characters find concrete reasons to stick together or else you may find the **GM** eventually running several solo-games that all just *happen* to be played at the same time. 

## The Session
This is the time, when the magic happens. The players and **GM** have come together and begin or continue the story. 

[Fate points](#fate-points) cannot be awarded during play and neither can cards be bought from the [hand of fate](#hand-of-fate). However, players and the **GM** should take note of every situation they believe a **PC** (their own included) could have earned a [fate point](#fate-points).

### Retell the Previous Session
At the start of a session, one of the players, or perhaps the **GM**, should recall and retell the events of the previous session. This lets everyone refamiliarize themselves with the story so far. It also provides the staging ground for events and actions to come. 

### The Scenario
It is up to the **GM** to get the ball rolling. They first frame the local area of the world the PCs find themselves in. They describe the scenario at hand - where the PCs are, what they can see, hear, smell and feel - and then ask "who does what?"

Then, the players must keep the ball rolling. In a given scenario, every PC should have something they wish to do. You could take turns or rely on first-come-first-serve, as long as everyone gets to state their character's [intent and action](#intent--action). Every action taken is then resolved, either formally through a [test](#tests) or informally with a direct description of what happens. 

> For example, stating your character will leave the room shouldn't warrant a [test](#tests), if there is no obstacle to overcome. Opening an unlocked door in a calm situation should be a "risk-free" thing to do. 
>
> However, when the same situation takes place during a time-critical phase, for example in a burning house and the door being locked, then a [test](#tests) to quickly force the lock or break down the door would be warranted. 

### Intent & Action
The players drive the story and the action. They decide what their character will try to do and the **GM** will help them figure out if things will go as planned. 

As a player, when deciding on what to do, make sure you state the **intent** of your action, like "I will make that person work for us!". 

Then, the **GM** will need to know *how* you aim to follow up on your intent. Describe the **action** you will take. The clearer, the better. "I will tell them of our exploits and how well we get paid!", is a good response and allows the **GM** to conclude you're trying to [persuade](#persuasion-emp) the other character. Even better would be something like "I will *persuade* them by telling them of our exploits and how well we get paid!" That leaves no room for doubt *how* you wish to achieve your goal, which makes the **GM**'s job easier and the game flow better. 

Of course, how appropriate a certain [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) is for the resolution of a given situation, is ultimately up to the **GM** and the specifics of the situation itself. 

When deciding on what to do, keep in mind your character's [personality](#personality) as that should inform you of the kinds of actions they might take. 

### Spending Time
Everything the PCs do takes time. How much time, exactly, is variable and depends on the point in the narrative the PCs are in. There are two levels of time-management. 

On the more abstract level, PCs commit to very abstract long-term actions. They might pursue their profession or recover from an injury, the process of which is only described very roughly. This level is called [down-time](#down-time). 

In contrast, on the more concrete level, PCs only commit to fine-grained short-term actions. This is when detailled descriptions and fine time slices come into play. Every action is as small as deciding to open a door that is right in front, on deciding to talk to someone they can see and such. This is considered the **scenario** or **encounter** level. 

Typically in RPGs, a fight is considered a **[combat](#combat) encounter**. Non-bloody interaction that involves speaking to NPCs or the PCs amongst themselves is considered a **social encounter**. There are also scenarios of exploration, investigation and survival. 

## After the Session
After a playing session is done, the players and **GM** should stick around to discuss which players earned [fate points](#fate-points). This is where players are nominated for [fate points](#fate-points), by each other and by the **GM**. If everyone agrees, the [fate points](#fate-points) are awarded. Players can and should lobby for their [fate points](#fate-points), but shouldn't beg. If most everyone else says no, then that decision stands. That doesn't mean there is no point in discussing the matter further, but such a discussion shoulnd't be forced. 

Also after the session, players and the **GM** discuss whether a **PC** should lose a [reaction](#reaction), because they have acted against it or haven't gotten to play it out at all. 

Any time in between sessions, players can spend [fate points](#fate-points) to buy cards (boons) from the [hand of fate](#hand-of-fate).

Also any time in between sessions, players should re-evaluate aspects of their character's [personality](#personality) and change them, as they see fit. 

## Tests
Whenever the outcome of an action or situation is uncertain, a **test** may be called for by the **GM**, in order to resolve it. 

As a basis for a test, either an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) is used. 

Either a **six** or a **five** rolled on a single die counts as a **positive**. Other values are considered **negatives**. **Positives** are required in order to succeed a test. 

How many **positives** are needed to succeed a test, is determined by the **GM**, via a mechanism called **obstacle** (henceforth referred to as **Ob**). The test can only succeed, if at least as many **positives** are rolled, as the **Ob** named by the **GM**. 

> For example, to succeed a test at **Ob 3**, at least three **positives** must be rolled to succeed the test. Any less, and the test outcome is a failure. 

To resolve an **attribute test**, the number of **D6** indicated by the *attribute level* (the number next to the attribute) must be rolled. 

To resolve a **skill test**, the number of **D6** indicated by the **skill level** (the number next to the skill), plus the related **attribute** as additional dice must be rolled. 

> A **PC** has an [agility](#agility-agi) of 3 and an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) skill at level 2. The player is asked to roll a test for [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) at **Ob** 2. They get to roll 3 + 2 = 5 **D6**, if they don't have any other skills to [fork](#skill-forking) into the test. 

A [skill being learned](#learning-skills) is tested with *only* the related **attribute**. 

For every test, one of three outcomes is possible: 
* **Complete Success**: There are enough or even more than required **positives**.
* **Partial Success/failure**: There are not enough **positives**, but more than none. 
* **Complete Failure**: There are no **positives**, only **negatives**. 

### Types of Test
There are the following types of tests. The **GM** decides when each type of test is appropriate. 

#### Binary Test
The outcome of the test is either a **complete success** or **complete failure**. A **partial success** is treated as if it were a **complete failure**. 

#### Stepped Test
A stepped test is really just a series of [binary tests](#binary-test). This allows for finer-grained results, while still not behaving like a [graduated test](#graduated-test). 

This type of test is useful for situations where the **GM** decides to create very fine *time slices* and allow more chances for success. This makes it easier to allow a **PC** to *fail forward* or prevent a *one roll to end it all* situation. 

> For example, a **PC** is attempting to cross a suspension bridge, but upon setting foot on the bridge, the ropes holding it up, suddenly snap. The **PC** can make an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test, to try and quickly jump off and back onto solid ground. They fail, and get to make another [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test at greater **Ob**, to try and grab a root sticking out of the ground beneath the bridge. They fail again! As a last chance for that **PC** to survive, the **GM** asks one of the other players if their character will attempt an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test at high **Ob**, to try and grab their falling ally's hand in a daring rescue. Finally, their ally succeeds and the **PC**'s life is saved. 
> 
> Obviously, such a situation should not arise often, as stepped tests can quickly grow exasperating. 

#### Graduated Test
The outcome of the test is graduated. That means, the number of **positives** rolled during the test factor into the outcome. This is called the **degree of success**. 

> For example, when crafting a work of art, the number of **positives** achieved may result in a more impressive piece, which can then be sold at a higher price or which could make for a more impressive gift. 

A **graduated test** can occur in two forms. The first is without an **Ob** threshold for failure and the second is *with* such a threshold. When a graduated test has an **Ob**, then at least that number of **positives** must be rolled, in order to succeed the test, at all. Any **positives** rolled past the **Ob**, determine the **degree of success**. However, not achieving at least **Ob** number of **positives** results in the test being counted as a **complete failure**. 

On the other hand, even a **complete failure** doesn't have to be *absolute*. The number of **positives** *missing* to reach the **Ob** threshold determine the **degree of failure**. Therefore, there might be a chance to "fail forward" - a success, but with complications, whose severity depends on the **degree of failure**. 

> For a test, a **PC** has to do a **graduated test** of one of their **craftsmanship** **skills**, at **Ob** 3. They only achieve only 2 **positives**, which results in a **degree of failure** of 1. 
> 
> Seeing such a low **degree of failure**, the **GM** rules that the PC *does* succeed their test, but also loses more materials in the process than a **complete success** would have cost them. 

#### Creative Test
Also known as a **skill challenge**, this type of test asks the player(s) to pick and justify the [skill(s)](#skills) or [attribute](#attributes) to use in a given situation. Players are encouraged to think creatively, come up with and describe their solutions. 

Whether the [attribute](#attributes) or [skill(s)](#skills) in question can apply to resolve the situation at hand, lies at the **GM**'s discretion. 

#### Opposed Test
Also known as a *versus test*, this type of test occurs, when two characters come into opposition. Who wins, and by how much, is determined by comparing the number of **positives** of each character. The one with the most **positives** is the winner. 

If there is a tie, the **defending** character is considered the winner. 

What this means, is that the defender first rolls a test of their respective skill, against **Ob 0** (this 'automatic success' does **not** count towards skill progression) and the number of **positives** that result, plus one, is the resulting **Ob** for the attacker to match or exceed. 

> In combat, a defender rolls their [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) and achieves 3 positives. Thus, the attacker must achieve at least 4 **positives**, in order to win the opposed test. 

Whoever actually wins the opposed test, gets to note a success on their respective skill, while the loser must note a failure on their respective skill. 

> In combat, a defender rolls **melee defence** and achieves 3 positives.
> 
> The attacker rolls an attack and achieves 3 **positives**. The **positives** being tied with the defenders', means the defender wins, by default. 
> 
> Thus, the defender notes a success on their **melee defence**, while the attacker must note a failure on their respective attack skill. 

The terms of **attacker** and **defender** refer to the character initiating and the character reacting to the **opposed test**, respectively. 

> For example, a character tries to sneak past another, the sneaking character will have to succeed a [stealth](#stealth-agi) test, while the other character will have to succeed an [observation](#observation-perc) test. If the result is a tie, the one making the observation test is considered the **defender**, and wins. 

If a tie occurs in which a **defender** cannot be clearly determined, the result is a deadlock and neither side gains anything. 

The defender **cannot** [fork](#skill-forking) other skills into their test, whereas the attacker **can**.

### Providing Assistance
Characters can help each other in tests. In order to help with a test, a character must know a relevant [skill](#skills) and the one being helped must accept the help. 

Helping in a test works much like [forking](#skill-forking) a skill. The character being helped receives **+1D6** to roll for each *character* helping them. The number of relevant skills a helping character has is irrelevant. Just one is enough to allow them to help and only one **+1D6** is granted by the helping character. Which skill is used to help with, matters, however. 

If a **PC** is helping another, their player must describe *how* they're using their relevant skill to help. 

> For example, a **PC** is currently using their [thievery](#thievery-agi) to lockpick a door. Their allied **PC** is *helping*, by using their [observation](#observation-perc) skill to *keep an eye out for guards*, which allows the one on the door to work without having to constantly look over their shoulder. The **GM** finds that description agreeable and allows the use of the skill to help. 

Ultimately, whether a skill is appropriate to help with is determined by the **GM**. 

#### Helpers Learn
A character helping in a test, also gains [progress](#advancing-skills) towards the [skill](#skills) and [attribute](#attributes) they've helped with. The outcome of the test for the character they've helped, is their own outcome. 

> If the character who was helped succeeded their test, the helper also gains a successful test to mark on their skill. 

#### Tests Bring about Learning
Whenever a [skill](#skills) or [attribute](#attributes) is tested, its outcome must be noted. 

When a [skill](#skills) is tested, both it **and** its associated [attribute](#attributes) is progressed. See also:
* [advancing skills](#advancing-skills)
* [advancing attributes](#advancing-attributes)

This excludes **Ob** 0 (= automatic success) tests. 

### Time
Not all tests are created equal - some actions require more time than others. 

While the **GM** decides on how much time a given test will need, the following guidelines should provide a good basis. 

* (Near) instantaneous: Combat actions, recalling knowledge, noticing things in passing. 
* A matter of minutes: inspecting an environment, quickly skimming the contents of a book, persuading someone in conversation, first aid. 
* A matter of hours: Simple crafts, surgery, scrutinizing an environment, researching something simple/not obscure, engaging in lengthy and difficult negotiations.
* A matter of days and months: Complex crafts and artistry, researching a complex or obscure subject. 

# Character
A character is a representation of a sentient creature in the game world. They're an amalgam of their [abilities](#abilities), [personality](#personality), [health](#health--exhaustion) and [assets](#assets). 

All **PC**s utilize all of these rules. **NPC**s are an exception, in that they don't *need* the [personality](#personality) section and **cannot** earn [fate points](#fate-points). 

## Abilities
All characters have innate and learned abilities. These are described as [attributes](#attributes) and [skills](#skills). 

These abilities determine the chance a character will succeed at the tasks they perform and improve as they're used. 

### Attributes
**Attributes** describe a character's basic, inherent abilities. 

The *modified* level of an **attribute** dictates the base number of **D6** to roll for a [test](#tests) of that **attribute**. 
* Two values must be tracked for every **attribute**: The *unmodified* and *modified* level. See [boons and penalties](#boons--penalties). 
* Unlike [skills](#skills), it is **not** possible to [fork](#skill-forking) **attributes**. 
* Attribute values typically range from 2 to 5 for ordinary human characters. 

**Attributes** [advance](#advancing-attributes), as they or [skills](#skills) that depend on them are [tested](#tests). It is also possible to [practice](#practicing-attributes) **attributes**. It is **not** possible to teach **attributes**, however. 

#### Physical Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic physical abilities. 

##### Agility [Agi]
Determines how nimble, fast and flexible a character is. Any action that requires a character to move very precisely, will require agility. 

##### Endurance [End]
Governs how long a character can endure physical strains. 

For every point in endurance, a character raises their [exhaustion threshold](#exhaustion) by 1. All characters have a base [exhaustion threshold](#exhaustion) of 1. 

Endurance also governs how long a character can hold their breath. Every point in endurance grants around 10 minutes. 

##### Perception [Perc]
Governs a character's ability to passively quickly pick up on fine and fleeting details in their environment or on objects and other characters. 

Also governs the ability to perceive under difficult conditions such as dim light and fog, or noisy and smelly environments. 

##### Strength [Str]
Governs a character's **strength** - the ability to lift, throw and break heavy and sturdy things. Such as skulls. 

Also governs the [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity) of a character. Each point in **strength** raises the [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity) of the character by 3. 

For every 3 points in **strength**, past the initial level, every [asset slot](#worn--equipped) of a character can hold **assets** of one bulk higher. 

> At level 3 in **strength**, a character can still only hold **assets** of bulk 2 in each hand. 
> 
> Starting at level 4 in **strength**, a character can hold **assets** of bulk 3 in each hand. Then, the next increase is at level 7, then level 10 and so on.

##### Toughness [Tough]
Governs the [injury limit](#injury) and chance to shrug off [bleeding](#bleeding) and [poison](#poisoned). 

For every point in [toughness](#toughness-tough), a character gains **+4 maximum HP** and raises their [injury](#injury) limit by 1. 

#### Mental Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic mental abilities. 

##### Intelligence [Int]
Governs a character's ability to reason and analyze. 

##### Wisdom [Wis]
Governs a character's understanding of and ability to recall knowledge. 

#### Social Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic social abilities. 

##### Empathy [Emp]
Governs a character's ability to read and understand another's emotions and intentions. 

##### Oratory [Ora]
Governs a character's ability to convincingly speak with and before others. Also used to manipulate others. 

##### Willpower [Will]
Governs a character's ability to withstand persuasion, intimidation, charm or terror. 

#### Advancing Attributes
Whenever a **PC** [tests](#tests) an [attribute](#attributes) or a [skill](#skills) that depends on it, progress towards advancing the [attribute](#attributes) must be noted. 

**Attribute** levels and advancement are divided into three tiers: **Underdeveloped**, **Average** and **Exceptional**. 
* Attributes are considered **underdeveloped** up to and including level 2. 
* Attributes are considered **average** starting from level 3, up to and including level 5. 
* Attributes are considered **exceptional** starting from level 6. 

Advancing an **underdeveloped attribute** requires:
* 15 + (N * 4) [tests](#tests). 
* Where *N* is the current level of the **attribute**. 

Advancing an **average attribute** requires:
* (N + 3) * (N + 2) [tests](#tests). 
* Where *N* is the current level of the **attribute**. 

Advancing an **exceptional attribute** requires:
* (N + 4) * (N + 3) [tests](#tests). 
* Where *N* is the current level of the **attribute**. 

For your convenience, the following table contains the precalculated requirements to advance an **attribute** level. 
* In the table, 'Level' is the character's *current level* in the **attribute**. 
* Note it is possible to go past level 10, but you shouldn't hope for it. 

| Level | Tests |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1     | 19    |
| 2     | 23    |
| 3     | 30    |
| 4     | 42    |
| 5     | 56    |
| 6     | 90    |
| 7     | 110   |
| 8     | 132   |
| 9     | 156   |
| 10    | 182   |

Whenever an attribute advances (= its level increases), advancement progress must be reset to 0. 

##### Practicing Attributes
It is possible to advance attributes *passively*. Whenever a large period of time is spent outside of active adventure, **PC**'s can practice an attribute of choice. 

A **PC** can only actively practice one **attribute**. Furthermore, a **PC** can not both be actively practicing an **attribute** *and* a **skill**. They must choose - either practice an **attribute** *or* a **skill**. 

For every **cycle** that passes of active practice, the **PC** can roll a [test](#tests) for the chosen **attribute**. 

A **cycle** is 2 Months, regardless of attribute being practiced. 

> A **PC** spends a year practicing their [wisdom](#wisdom-wis), while the **GM** prepares the next story arc. In this case, 5 tests can be made and progress noted. 

#### Base Initiative
Whenever the order in which characters act matters, their **base initiative** comes into play. It, together with a dice roll, determine how early a character gets to take action in a given scenario. 

The **base initiative** of a character is **not an attribute** in the pure sense. It *cannot* be improved directly and is instead derived from the sum of the character's [perception](#perception-perc), [intelligence](#intelligence-int) and [empathy](#empathy-emp). 

> A character with a **perception** of 3, **intelligence** of 4 and **empathy** of 5, has a **base initiative** of 12. 

See also [initiative](#initiative). 

### Skills
A **skill** is any acquired knowledge and experience regarding a specific subject. 

Two values must be tracked for every **skill**: The *unmodified* and *modified* level. See [boons and penalties](#boons--penalties). The *modified* level of a **skill** dictates the base number of **D6** to roll for a [test](#tests) of that **skill**.

When [testing](#tests) a **skill**, add half of the related [attribute](#attributes)'s value (rounded down) as an additional number of dice for the test. It is also possible to [fork](#skill-forking) **skills**, allowing even more dice to be used the test. 

**Skills** [advance](#advancing-skills), as they're tested. It is also possible to [practice](#practicing-skills) and [teach](#teaching-skills) **skills**. 

#### Skill Abilities
Skills can be the *owner* of **skill abilities** associated with them. A **skill ability** is either a *passive* [boon](#boons--penalties) or an *active* **action**, with effects that apply when used.  

Every **skill ability** can have the following properties:
* A **required level** at which they unlock. This is the level of their *owning* **skill**. 
  * A **skill ability** may only be used, if the character has the *owning* **skill** with at least this level. 
  * A **skill ability** noting level 0 or no level at all, can be used right away, even without any levels in the *owning* **skill**. 
* An [AP](#action-points-ap) cost. 
  * During [combat](#combat) how often **skill abilities** may be used is restricted by how much a character can do in a single **turn**. 
  * A cost of 0 implies the use of the **skill ability** is free and can potentially be repeated multiple times in a single **turn**. 
* A **condition** which restricts when and how often they can be used. 
  * Some **skill abilities** can only be used as a *reaction* to another character's **action**. 
  * Some **skill abilities** can only be used once per scenario, once per day or only when other specific circumstances align. 
* An **Ob**. 
  * When an **Ob** is noted, the *owning* skill must be [tested](#tests) at this **Ob**. It is also possible that instead of a fixed **Ob**, a dynamic number is used. For example, whenever an [opposed test](#opposed-test) is required. In case of an [opposed test](#opposed-test), the opposing **skill** will also be noted. The opposing character must use that **skill** to oppose the use of this **skill ability**. In some cases, the opposing character may abstain from resisting. 
  * A **skill ability** without a noted **Ob** does *not* require a [test](#tests) to be made. 
* A [targeting-type](#targeting-types). 
  * This restricts how many targets may be affected at once by a **skill ability**'s use. 
* A **maximum distance** at which it may apply to targets. 
* One or more **damage** values of a specified [type](#damage-types). 
  * When successfully used, damage can be applied to the [HP](#hit-points-hp) of one or more targets. 
  * Damage can be noted either as a *flat* value, or a formula, which may involve dice rolls for variable damage. E. g. "3D3 + 5". 

Using a **skill ability** counts as an **action**. 

[Weapon skills](#weapon--weapon-type--str) use **skill abilities** to denote the ways one can attack with them. 

##### Targeting-Types
The number of targets that a [skill ability](#skill-abilities) can apply to, with a single use, is defined through the **targeting-types**. 

###### Single Target (ST)
A **single-target** (**ST**) action affects only a single target. 

###### Multiple Single Target (MST)
A **single-target** (**ST**) action affects up to a maximum number of targets. 

###### Area of Effect (AoE)
**Area of Effect** (**aoe**) actions affect *every* target that is in the area of effect. 

#### Skill Forking
For every **skill** a character knows (= is not currently still learning), and they are currently testing a **skill** that is thematically related, they can **fork** that **skill** into their test, granting them **+1D6** for their [test](#tests). 

> Imagine a large forked rivermouth. One of the forks feeding into it is also a large river, which represents the **skill** primarily being tested. The other, smaller forks of the river represent the supporting **skills**. They all combine together at the rivermouth. A primary and its supporting **skills** flow together into the test! 

> For example, if a character is testing their [thievery](#thievery-dex--perc--spd) **skill** at level 3 and they also know [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int), they can **fork** their stealth **skill** into their thievery test. Any number of **skills** can be **forked** into a test, but each **fork** only grants **+1D6**. For the thievery test above, it doesn't matter if the character is at stealth level one or five or nine-thousand. They only get a **+1D6** to their thievery test. So in this case, if the **GM** agrees, the player gets to roll **4D6** for their test. 

Which **skills** can be **forked** into a particular test is up to the **GM**. If a player is performing a test, they can lobby for the use of the **skills** they want to **fork** into their particular test, but ultimately, if the **GM** says no, that decision is final. 

> Back to the thievery example. Let's assume a **PC** is trying to quickly unlock a door using their [thievery](#thievery-dex--perc--spd), because they're being chased by guards and desperately need to get away. They could argue to fork their [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int) **skill** into the test, but ultimately, what use is stealth when you've already been detected? Unless you can make yourself *unseen* somehow, the **GM** should rule that stealth cannot apply in that situation. 

#### Learning Skills
Whenever asked to test a skill a **PC** does not yet know, it will be added or progressed in the *currently learning* section of the character sheet. 

A skill in learning can only be tested with half their related [attribute](#attributes) (rounded down). If multiple attributes are listed for the skill, you can choose which one to test with. 

> A player is asked to test their character's [Leatherworking](#leatherworking-agi) at **Ob** 2. Their character lacks that skill and thus adds it to the *currently learning* section on their character sheet. Assuming their character has an agility of 3, they get to roll **3D6**. But since this is a skill being learned, the **Ob** must be doubled. 
> 
> The player cannot, mathematically, succeed a test at **Ob 4** with just **3D6**. Their character fails, but at least they learned a little from the attempt, which is noted on the skill in the *currently learning* section. 

The outcome of a test gets noted on the skill it was made for, not the attribute actually used for the test. 

[Forking](#skill-forking) learning skills into tests is not allowed. **Forking** into tests of learning skills isn't allowed, either. 

It **is** possible to receive help or [tutoring](#teaching-skills) on a learning skill. 

#### Advancing Skills
Whenever a **PC** uses a **skill** in a [test](#tests), the outcome must be noted, both on the skill **and** its associated [attribute](#attributes). See also: [Tests Bring about Learning](#tests-bring-about-learning)

Skill levels and advancement are divided into three tiers: **Dabbling**, **Apprentice** and **Master**. 
* Skills at **dabbling level** are any skills at level 0, which means any [learning skill](#learning-skills). They are hard to learn without help. 
* Skills at **apprentice level** are easier to improve and range from the levels 1 to and including 4. 
* Skills at **master level** are very hard to improve and start at, including, 5. Mastery is open-ended, which means it doesn't, technically, stop. 

Advancing a **dabbling skill** (level 0) requires: 
* 6 **complete successes**. 
* 9 **partial successes** or **complete failures**. 

Advancing an **apprentice skill** (level 1-4) requires:
* (N + 1) * 2 **complete successess**.
* (N + 1) * 3 **partial successess** or **complete failures**.
* Where *N* is the *current* level of the akill. 

Advancing a **master skill** (level 5+) requires:
* N * N **complete successess**.
* (N + 1) * (N + 1) **partial successess** or **complete failures**.
* Where *N* is the *current* level of the akill. 

> A character has a [nature](#nature-int) **skill** at level 2. 
> 
> To advance their **skill** to level 3, they would need (2 + 1) * 2 = 6 **complete successes** and (2 + 1) * 3 = 9 **partial successess** or **complete failures**.

For your convenience, the following table contains the precalculated requirements to advance a **skill** level. 
* In the table, 'Level' is the character's *current level* in the **skill**. 
* Note it is possible to go past level 10, but you shouldn't hope for it any time soon. 

| Level | Successes | Failures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 6   | 9   |
| 1   | 4   | 6   |
| 2   | 6   | 9   |
| 3   | 8   | 12  |
| 4   | 10  | 15  |
| 5   | 25  | 36  |
| 6   | 36  | 49  |
| 7   | 49  | 64  |
| 8   | 64  | 81  |
| 9   | 81  | 100 |
| 10  | 100 | 121 |

Whenever a skill advances, its associated successes and failures must each be reset to 0. Successes and failures accumulated past the threshold do not carry over. They're "lost". 

##### Practicing Skills
It is possible to advance **skills** *passively*. Whenever a large period of time is spent outside of active adventure, **PC**'s can practice a skill of choice. 

A **PC** can only actively practice one **category of skills**. For every **cycle** that passes of active practice, the **PC** can roll a [test](#tests) of a skill of the corresponding category. Furthermore, a **PC** can not both be actively practicing a **skill** *and* an **attribute**. They must choose - either practice a **skill** *or* an **attribute**. 

| Skill Category | Cycle    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Physical       | 3 Weeks  |
| Social         | 2 Weeks  |
| Craftsmanship  | 1 Month  |
| Knowledge      | 2 Months |

> A **PC** spends seven weeks practicing their [fishing](#fishing-end), while waiting for their comrade to recover from their [injuries](#injury). [fishing](#fishing-end) being a physical skill, the cycle for tests is 3 weeks. In this case, 2 tests can be made and their outcomes noted. 

##### Teaching Skills
Much like it is possible for a character to [practice](#practicing-skills) on their own, they can also be taught by another, who knows more than them. 

Both teacher and pupil must actively spend time together, furthering the pupil's skill. The rules for cycle and test are the same as with [practice](#practicing-skills). The cycles noted in the table below are used instead. 

| Skill Category | Cycle    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Physical       | 2 Weeks  |
| Social         | 1 Week   |
| Craftsmanship  | 3 Weeks  |
| Knowledge      | 1 Month  |

If the teacher's skill is at least one level higher than that of their student, the student can use an extra **+1D6** to resolve their tests of the skill they're being taught. 

## Personality
All **PC**s have a **personality**, which is an expression of their [personality traits](#personality-traits), [ambition](#ambition), [aspirations](#aspiration) and [reactions](#reaction). 

All aspects of a **PC**s **personality** may change, as the game is played. Through their actions and the situations they're confronted with, a character's **personality** may be affected. 

It is from this fluidity, that a character becomes so interesting to explore, because even as their player, you might not know how the world and events they experience may affect them. They're a book you start writing from the beginning - not the ending.

In addition to that, players can earn a meta-currency called [fate points](#fate-points), by playing their character either in accordance with their **personality**, or by dramatically breaking with it. It is the **GM**'s job to present the **PC**s with conflicts that will challenge their **personality** and it is the player's job to provide answers. 

Of course, even **NPC**s have a **personality**, but unlike **PC**s, this is not cemented through rules and they **cannot** earn [fate points](#fate-points). 

The [ambition](#ambition), [aspirations](#aspiration) and [reactions](#reaction) are grouped together and referred to as the character's **drivers** or **driver system**. This **driver system** prevents inaction and thus stagnation of the character's development, as they'll always have some goal to work towards. 

### Ambition
Every **PC** must have one **ambition** - a life-fulfilling long-term goal to pursue. This can be anything from "found a family" to "become king of the world!". No matter how unrealistic, an **ambition** is a primary driver for a character, to guide them onward. The important part is to think *big*. Something easily achievable would make for a dull **ambition** and defeat the point of it. 

An **ambition** is not *expected* to change often. An ideal **ambition** would accompany a character a long time. 

Whenever a **PC** acts in accordance with their **ambition**, their player earns [fate points](#fate-points). 

### Aspiration
Every **PC** must have three **aspirations** - immediate goals to pursue in the current game session. They're usually born from circumstance and are expected to change frequently. 

**Aspirations** should be a *conviction*, followed by an *actionable* goal to pursue. Any **aspiration** that includes the words "I will ..." is usually *actionable* - the character wants to **do** something, which will possibly achieve their goal. A *conviction* is a statement of *why* the character has set this goal. 

> For example, a **PC** learns of a conspiracy against their lord during the session. After the session, they decide they'll change one of their **aspirations** to "My lord's safety is paramount! I will uncover the plot against my lord!"
>
> The first part is the *conviction* - the *why* - and the second part the action they want to take - that which makes the **aspiration** *actionable*. 
> 
> With that they set the stage for their character when the next session arrives. The **GM** thus has an idea of what story elements to prepare for and the other players know why the one **PC** suddenly acts more suspiciously and inquisitively. 

**Aspirations** can be directed towards anyone - including the world itself, **NPC**s and even other **PC**s. 

> For example, a **PC** learns their ally is a member of a secretive and potentially dangerous cult. After the session, the player determines the new **aspiration** "I look out for my allies! I will get my ally to leave that dangerous cult!" 
> 
> Whether successful or not, this **aspiration**, in play, will create an **interesting conflict** between the two **PC**s. But always keep in mind not to do anything *too* drastic or antagonistic towards fellow **PC**s. After all, why should people who actually hate each other's guts stick together as a group? Perhaps you can find a good reason, but this should be a deliberate decision that the entire player group agrees on. 

Whenever a **PC** acts in accordance with their **aspirations**, their player earns [fate points](#fate-points). 

### Reaction
A player must determine three **reactions** for their character. A **reaction** is an automatic behavior - something the character is *expected* to do *automatically* and without question, when a given situation triggers it. But *expected* doesn't mean *have to*. A player can *choose* to have their character act against a **reaction** - and that may cause them to lose it. 

A **reaction** is an "if/then" and "always/never" statement, which can be be beneficial or detrimental to the character. 

As such, there are two types of **reactions**:
* **Troublemaker**: A detrimental **reaction**, that will get the character in *trouble*.
  * A **troublemaker** allows earning [fate points](#fate-points). 
  * *Trouble* is defined as any situation in which a mild conflict arises, from the **PC**'s **reaction**. This conflict does not have to be violent, mind you. It should be preferable for a social conflict to arise, that is entirely non-violent. Things could always escalate, of course.
* **Assurance**: A beneficial **reaction** that acts as *insurance*, that the character won't be caught by surprise. 
  * An **assurance** does not allow earning [fate points](#fate-points). 
  * *Insurance* is defined as a *behavior* that allows entering a given situation under more favorable circumstances. An *insurance* can also help prevent or resolve a conflict. 
  * An **assurance** cannot alter the facts of the narrative. It **only** serves to give a **PC** an advantage in a situation that triggers this **reaction**. 

> For example: "Whenever someone praises the state religion, I start ranting against it." - This is a **troublemaker**, as the **GM** can use it to cause the **PC** trouble, by presenting them with non-player characters that praise the state religion while around the **PC**. 

> Another example: "Whenever a violent fight breaks out, I have my weapons in hand!" - This is insurance, that even when the **PC** narratively might not have their weapons at the ready (for example, when sleeping), they will, in fact, have them at the ready. 

**Reactions** are expected to change whenever a character (decides) to act against them. A **PC** cannot keep a **reaction** they keep contradicting. Players and the **GM** are expected to discuss at the end or beginning of a session, whether anyone should give up one of their **reactions**. 

### Personality Traits
Every **PC** has several values that help inform their player what their character is like - how they act. 

This personality is codified by the following matrix. Each row is a scale, with two opposing traits. Whenever A trait reaches the "signature" column, a **PC** is known for that trait! In fact, they can hardly *not* act that way! In order for behaviour to deviate from a signature trait, a **D6** has to be rolled. Only if it is a **positive**, can the player choose to deviate from the signature trait's dictated behavior. 

Whenever **PC**s very strongly act in a certain way, their value in a **personality trait** may change. Take note during play, how the characters have acted. After the session, discuss whether any of the **PC**s have shown a very strong drift towards either side of the scale. And if everyone agrees, a personality change is in order!

| Trait       | Signature | Very | A little | Undecided | A little | Very | Signature | │ Trait      |
| ----------- | --------- | ---- | -------- | --------- | -------- | ---- | --------- | ------------ |
| Arrogant    |│          |│     |│         |│          |│         |│     |│          | │ Humble     |
| Cowardly    |│          |│     |│         |│          |│         |│     |│          | │ Courageous |
| Cruel       |│          |│     |│         |│          |│         |│     |│          | │ Merciful   |
| Deceitful   |│          |│     |│         |│          |│         |│     |│          | │ Honest     |
| Lazy        |│          |│     |│         |│          |│         |│     |│          | │ Energetic  |
| Paranoid    |│          |│     |│         |│          |│         |│     |│          | │ Naive      |
| Reckless    |│          |│     |│         |│          |│         |│     |│          | │ Prudent    |
| Selfish     |│          |│     |│         |│          |│         |│     |│          | │ Considerate|
| Vengeful    |│          |│     |│         |│          |│         |│     |│          | │ Forgiving  |

These values can even have an impact on your [tests](#tests)! For example, a character who is known to be merciful may find it easier to convince their enemies to surrender to them. On the other hand, if that same **PC** tries intimidation, they will find it harder to succeed. 

Keep your character's **personality traits** in mind and remember to ask your **GM** for a bonus die to roll in [tests](#tests), where your "very" strong or "signature" traits might aid you!

Additionally, playing to or even against their character's **personality traits** allows earning a player [fate points](#fate-points). 

## Health & Exhaustion
Every character has **Hit Points (HP)** and a maximum number of **injuries** they can endure (= their **injury limit**), before they die. 

### Hit Points (HP)
Whenever a character is hurt, the **damage** that has been inflicted upon them is deducted from their **HP**. Whenever their **HP** reach zero, they suffer an [injury](#injury) and their **maximum HP** is reduced by **2**. 

So, in other words, for every [injury](#injury), a character loses 2 maximum **HP**. But even when [Toughness](#toughness-tough) is reduced by an [injury](#injury), still only 2 maximum **HP** are deducted. 

Any **HP** damage past zero overflows. The additional damage dealt isn't lost. 

Outside of combat, a successful [medicine](#medicine-int) test, requiring medical supplies, can restore all currently missing **HP** of a character. 

### Injury
An **injury** is a serious health impediment of a character. Every character has a maximum number of [injuries](#injury) they can endure. If they reach their maximum number of [injuries](#injury), the character dies. **PC**s are an exception, who instead arrive at [death's door](#deaths-door). 

Whenever a character suffers an [injury](#injury), a **D100** must be rolled and the corresponding result from the [list of injuries](#list-of-injuries) added to the character. Depending on the type of damage and the situation in question, a different injury table may be rolled on or a "flat" injury may be applied, instead. See also the [list of type specific injuries](#type-specific-injuries).

For every **injury** incurred, a character's maximum **HP** is reduced by 2. 

An [injury](#injury) can reduce [attributes](#attributes) and impose other restrictions. See also [boons & penalties](#boons--penalties). 

When an **injury** is fully healed and removed, it may leave behind a [scar](#scars). 

#### Injury States
There are four possible states of an [injury](#injury): **active**, **patched up**, **treated** or **permanent**. 

Only an **active** [injury](#injury) imposes negative effects, but **injuries** will always be counted toward the injury limit. 

An [injury](#injury) can be **patched up** via [medicine](#medicine-int):
* If the attempt is a complete success, the [injury](#injury) is **patched up**.
* If the attempt is a partial success or a complete failure, the [injury](#injury) remains **active**. 

A **patched up** [injury](#injury) still reduces a character's **maximum HP** and must be counted when checking whether they must perform their [toughness](#toughness-tough) test when suffering more **injuries**. 

An [injury](#injury) can be properly **treated** via [surgery](#surgery-int): 
* If the attempt is a complete success, the [injury](#injury) is **treated**. 
* If the attempt is a partial success, the [injury](#injury) is not **treated**, but another attempt can be made. 
* If the attempt is a complete failure, the [injury](#injury) becomes **permanent**. It cannot be **treated** via [surgery](#surgery-int) anymore. 
* Only one [surgery](#surgery-int) attempt can be made every 24 hours. 

All currently **treated** [injuries](#injury) can be removed/recovered from, by spending **4D4** weeks in uninterrupted, active recovery. Active recovery implies spending the vast majority of the day in bed or at least avoiding physical and mental strains. 

#### Injury Exhaustion Threshold
Once a character is brought to at least half their maximum number of [injuries](#injury) (rounded down), every time past that point that they suffer further damage and/or an **injury** they must succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test with their number of **injuries** as the **Ob**, or else suffer +1 [exhaustion](#exhaustion). This point in time is called the **injury exhaustion threshold**. 

> A character is injured in combat. They have an **injury limit** of 3 and already suffered an **injury** earlier. Even though the earlier **injury** may have been **patched up** by now, the character's new **injury** brings them up to a total of 2 **injuries**. 
> 
> This means that they've gone past their **injury exhaustion threshold**. Now, they must succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test at **Ob** 2, or else suffer +1 [exhaustion](#exhaustion). 

### Exhaustion
Exhaustion is the measure of a character's maximum physical and mental strain they can endure. 

For every point in [endurance](#endurance-end), a character raises their [exhaustion threshold](#exhaustion) by 1. All characters have a base [exhaustion threshold](#exhaustion) of 1. 

If a character's exhaustion reaches their threshold, they become [exhausted](#exhausted) from over-exertion. 

Exhaustion is gained through performing **exhausting actions**, carrying **exhausting equipment** or suffering [injuries](#injury). 

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions** can be reduced by resting. A full rest of at least **six uninterrupted hours** will fully clear any exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions**. 

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting equipment**, can be reduced, by dropping the equipment in question and resting for a short while, at the **GM**'s discretion. A character trying to carry more than they can endure, should not immediately fall [unconscious](#unconscious), mind you. Apply common sense - the character in question would probably try to carry the extra equipment, only find out right away it is simply too much for them. 

### State
A **character** can have positive or negative effects on them, represented by **states**. They can have any number of **states** applying to them. 

#### Berserk
A character who is in **berserk**, **must** attack the creature nearest to them. 

This **state** lasts until it is successfully [resisted](#resist-will) or the character is made [unconscious](#unconscious). 

#### Burning
A **burning** character suffers 1 point of [HP](#health--exhaustion) damage at the end their every turn in combat or every 2 seconds outside of combat. 

This **state** can be incurred multiple times. While a character has this **state**, at every end of their turn during combat or every 2 seconds outside of combat, they automatically incur another point of **burning**! They must actively work to get rid of it, for example by dropping to the floor and rolling on the flames, dousing themselves in water and so forth. The point of **burning** is incurred *after* the damage from the previous points of **burning** is applied. 

#### Bleeding
A **bleeding** character suffers 1 point of [HP](#health--exhaustion) damage at the end their every turn in combat or every 5 seconds outside of combat. 

This **state** can be incurred multiple times. 

A point of **bleeding** can be removed with a successful [medicine](#medicine-int) test, requiring a bandage. 

At the end of every combat round of every 5 seconds outside of combat, a character can attempt to shrug off 1 point of **bleeding**, by succeeding a [toughness](#toughness-tough) [test](#tests), the **Ob** of which is their number of points of **bleeding**, times 2. 

> A character with 2 points of **bleeding** must succeed a test at **Ob** 4, to shrug off 1 point of **bleeding**. 

#### Death's Door
**Death's door** is a **state** only a **PC** can enter and represents their final battle with death. 

A **PC** at **death's door** must succeed at least one [toughness](#toughness-tough) test out of a possible of three. If they never succeed, they perish, irrevocably*. The **Ob** is determined as half of the character's [toughness](#toughness-tough), rounded up. 
* If the character is at **death's door** during [combat](#combat), they must make a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test at the end of every round. 
* If the character is at **death's door** out of [combat](#combat), they must make a test every minute. 

A character can be helped out of the **death's door** **state**, if all of their **active** [injuries](#injury) are **patched up** or **treated**. 

#### Dissolving
A **dissolving** character suffers **1D5** points of [HP](#health--exhaustion) damage at the end their every turn in combat or every 2 seconds outside of combat. 

This **state** is removed automatically, if the character is freed of the acidic substance. 

#### Drug-Addicted
A **drug-addicted** character must take their drug once every 24 hours, or else enter **withdrawal**. 

For every 24 hours that a character is in **withdrawal**, they suffer **-1D** to **all** tests. For every 12 hours that they are in **withdrawal** they have to pass a [willpower](#willpower-will) test at **Ob** 2, or else be forced to dedicate their every whole strength into acquiring and taking a new dose of the drug. 

After 72 consecutive hours (= 3 full days) of having being in **withdrawal**, the character breaks free from their addiction, removing this **health state**.

#### Electrified
An **electrified** character suffers **-1D** for their every [test](#tests) requiring [agility](#agility-agi). That means [attributes](#attributes) and [skills](#skills). 

This **state** is removed automatically, at the end of the character's next turn in combat or after 5 seconds outside of combat. 

#### Exhausted
An **exhausted** character begins their turn with -2 **AP** and can run at most only half the distance they normally could. [Sprinting](#combat-movement) is impossible. In addition, they suffer a penalty of **-1D** to all tests. The number of dice for a test cannot be reduced to less than 1 by this penalty. 

This **state** can be recovered from either by succeeding a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test with **Ob** at half **toughness**, rounded up or by **actively resting** at least half an hour. 

#### Frostbitten
A **frostbitten** character suffers -1 [AP](#action-points-ap) during combat. 

This state can be incurred up to 2 times. At the end of every turn during combat, one point of **frostbitten** is removed, automatically, unless if the character is in a cold environment. In cold environments, the **frostbitten** stays, until actively removed, for example by heating up around a fire, drinking a hot beverage and so on. 

#### Grappled
A **grappled** character is unable to move and suffers -1 [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi), for as long as they are **grappled**. A **grappled** character can break free, by **completely succeeding** a [strength](#strength-str) test against the other character grappling them. 

#### Hasted
A **hasted** character enjoys several benefits.

During combat, the character has an additional **AP** to spend and an additional 9'/3m of movement per **AP**. 

Out of combat, the character enjoys greater speed of movement. 

#### Jealous
A character who has been made unnaturally **jealous**, will do anything in their power to take, whatever it may be, from whoever might have *it*. 

This **state** lasts until it is successfully [resisted](#resist-will) or the character is made [unconscious](#unconscious). 

#### Pacified
A character who is **pacified**, is unable to *willingly* take any action that would directly or indirectly harm any other creature. 

Note, the character is not physically unable to cause harm, but they **really** don't want to. 

This **state** lasts until it is successfully [resisted](#resist-will) or the character is made [unconscious](#unconscious). 

#### Poisoned
A **poisoned** character suffers 1 points of [HP](#health--exhaustion) damage at the end their every turn in combat or every 5 seconds outside of combat. 

This state can be incurred multiple times and can be removed with an *antidote*. 

At the end of every combat round of every 5 seconds outside of combat, a character can attempt to shrug off 1 point of **poisoned**, by succeeding a [toughness](#toughness-tough) [test](#tests), the **Ob** of which is their number of points of **poisoned**, times 2. 

> A character with 2 points of **poisoned** must succeed a test at **Ob** 4, to shrug off 1 point of **poisoned**. 

#### Prone
A character who is prone, is harder to hit with ranged attacks, but easier to hit with melee attacks, as they'll have a harder time defending. 

* **-1D** to [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) tests. 
* **-1D** to any attack tests. 
* **+1D** to [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi) tests. 

It costs 1 [AP](#action-points-ap) to stand up. 

#### Rooted
A **rooted** character can no longer move their legs. They cannot move from the spot, but can still move their upper body freely. 

This **state** is usually tied to some condition, before it is removed. 

#### Terrified
A **terrified** character suffers **-2D** to both their melee and ranged defence and **has to** run away from whatever it is that terrified them, until they break line of sight to it and can no longer hear it. 

This **state** lasts until either the source of terror is removed or until it is successfully [resisted](#resist-will). 

#### Unconscious
An **unconscious** character is unable to act and is unaware of their surroundings. 

Someone *knocked* **unconscious** can't awaken due to external stimuli and have to recover, first. For how long, depends on the circumstances. But several hours hould be a good baseline. A character can be *knocked* **unconscious**, if they're at their exhaustion threshold and suffer any [bludgeoning](#damage-types) damage and fail an [endurance](#endurance-end) [test](#tests). The **Ob** is 2 + 1 per level of exhaustion past the threshold.

> A character is brought to an exhaustion level of 4 with bludgeoning damage, which is 1 point past their exhaustion threshold of 3. They must succeed an **endurance** test at **Ob** 3, or else be knocked unconscious. 

### Illness
An illness can affect a character over a perod of time and cause various negative effects. 

Illness can be contracted in a variety of ways, although most of them involve an open wound exposed to bacterial breeding grounds, such as bogs, sewers, mass graves and trash dumps. Or from something ingested, such as spoiled or poisoned food. 

When a character is about to contract an illness, they most make a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test:
* On a **complete success**, the illness is shrugged off. 
* On a **partial success** or **complete failure**, the illness is contracted and will immediately apply its effects to the character. 
* If they contracted the illness, determine which one by rolling a **D100** and picking the corresponding illness from the [list of illnesses](#list-of-illnesses). 
  * Once the illness has been determined, its duration and severity must also be rolled. 

Most illnesses have a duration, during which their effects are active and after which, all ill-effects go away. In some cases, an illness may have a duration of "until cured", which means it will never go away, if not treated. 

Treatment of an illness is possible through [medicine](#medicine-int) or [surgery](#surgery-int). Which skill is required, will be noted on the illness. Treatment will often be able to reduce the ill-effects and sometimes to remove the illness, altogether. A treatment attempt can only be made once every 24 hours. 

Any illness, that when treated has its duration reduced, can only have its duration reduced once. If a treatment would also suspend any ill-effects, that would still be applicable. That way, treating an illness which already had its duration reduced can still be useful. 

An **illness** can only be suffered once, at a time. It may be suffered again later, but you could also expect that a certain level of immunity within the body has built up, after the previous time it was suffered through. 

### Scars
Some [injuries](#injury), once fully healed and removed, may leave a **scar** behind. If they do, this information will be specified on the [injuries](#injury) in question. See also the [list of scars](#list-of-scars). 

Often times, a **scar** is little more than a reminder of past misfortunes, but some **scars** may infer [boons and/or penalties](#boons--penalties). 

Scars may be removed by [surgery](#surgery-int), at the **GM**'s discretion. 

### Damage Types
All damage inflicted, is inflicted with a certain type of damage. 

| Damage Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Slashing    | Usually inflicted by any sort of cutting/slashing weapon, like a sword, or a talon. |
| Piercing    | Usually inflicted by any sort of stabbing weapon, like a spear, or an animal's stinger. |
| Bludgeoning | Inflicted by light blunt weapons and [unarmed](#unarmed-combat-str) attacks. **Bludgeoning** causes non-lethal damage. It inflicts [exhaustion](#exhaustion) instead of [injuries](#injury). An [exhausted](#exhausted) character hit with **bludgeoning** damage has to succeed an [endurance](#endurance-end) [test](#tests), or else fall [unconscious](#unconscious). The **Ob** is 2 + 1 per level of exhaustion past the threshold. |
| Crushing    | Usually inflicted by any sort of heavy blunt weapon, like a hammer, or an animal's tusks. |
| Burning     | Inflicted by extreme heat. |
| Freezing    | Inflicted by extreme cold. |
| Poison      | Inflicted over time, by imbibed or injected substances. |
| Acid        | Dissolves anything it touches, or perhaps just organic matter. |
| Electrical  | Destroyer and giver of life. Mind maker and unmaker. Whip of light and sound. There aren't many sources for electricity, besides nature herself. |

### Damage Resistances
Some creatures can resist certain [types of damage](#damage-types) naturally, while others may cover themselves in armor to the same effect. 

How much **damage** is resisted, depends on the specifics of the creature or character and their [equipment](#worn--equipped). 

### Boons & Penalties
Boons and penalties to the level of an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) can be incurred from several different sources, such as [injuries](#injury), [illnesses](#illness), [mutations](#list-of-mutations), [scars](#scars) and [states](#state). Boons and penalties may be temporary or permanent, depending on their source. 

A boon to an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) usually comes in the form of increasing its level. If a boon awards an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) that the character does not yet have, they gain it automatically. 

A penalty to an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) usually comes in the form of decreasing its level. A penalty **cannot** reduce an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) to 0. The minimum reduction is to 1. An exception to this rule is, when the character's only reason for having the [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) is a boon. In that case, the penalty **can** reduce the level to 0, effectively removing the [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills). 

Therefore, an [attribute's](#attributes) or [skill's](#skills) *unmodified* level must be tracked separately from its *modified* level. 

Whenever a boon or penalty alters the level of an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills), it does **not** affect the **successes** and **failures** required to advance. 

## Assets
A character may have things on their person, such as worn equipment and luggage, as well as the things they *own*, but don't have on person. 

Collectively, these things are referred to as their **assets**. 

### Bulk
Every non-static asset (= any object that can reasonably be picked up) has a **bulk** associated with it. This value determines how easy to handle the asset is.

A lower bulk means an easier to handle asset. 

### Worn & Equipped
Every character can have **assets** they wear or carry on person. These things do not factor into their used [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity) and are listed on their character sheet in a separate section. Every asset on person has to be placed in a so called **asset slot**. 

Every **asset slot** has a maximum bulk it can hold. Two or more **slots** of the **same type** can be combined to hold a single asset that is too bulky for just one slot. The amount of bulk each slot can hold can be increased with greater [strength](#strength-str). 

Every humanoid character has the following **slots** for worn & equipped **assets** available:
* One slot for clothing of up to 3 bulk. 
* One slot for armor of up to 3 bulk. 
* A slot for every hand of up to 2 bulk. 
  * This would allow creatures with more than two appendages to potentially hold a lot more things. 
* One slot for a back-strapped thing of up to 3 bulk. 
  * A backpack or similar thing need not be listed, as it is implied by the ability to have [luggage](#luggage) on person. 
* Slots for any number of worn jewelry or other ornaments.
  * This only considers *light* jewelry and ornaments. Things that wouldn't encumber their wearer noticeably. Such things as rings, bracelets, a circlet or similar. 

### Luggage
In addition to the things a character can *wear* on their person, they can also carry around things in a backpack, in pouches, slung over the shoulder or using whatever on person storage solution available. These things are considered a character's **luggage**. 

Things such as money, valuables, camping equipment, tools, provisions, ammunition and so on, all count as **luggage**. 

How much **luggage** a character can have on them, is determined by their [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity). For every point of it, a character gets one *slot* for a piece of **luggage**. 

#### Carrying Capacity
How much [luggage](#luggage) a character can have on them, is determined by their **carrying capacity**, which is a **bulk** limit of **assets** that a person can be carrying around on their person. [Worn & equipped](#worn--equipped) **assets** are *excluded* and don't count towards this limit. 

A character's **carrying capacity** is determined by their [strength](#strength-str). For each point in [strength](#strength-str), a character raises their **carrying capacity** by 3. 

### Property
Often times, characters will also own things they don't currently have on their person, or which they couldn't reasonably carry on person. 

Things such as an owned plot of land, a house, money in the bank, equipment and tools left at home and so on, all count as **property**. Technically, it wouldn't be incorrect to consider things a character has on person as **property**, as well, but it would bloat up a character sheet unnecessarily to list those things twice. 

There is no limit for how much **property** a character can have. Except, perhaps, how much they can keep safe from greedy hands. 

### Weapon Properties
Weapon type assets can have the following **properties**:
* **Long Reach**: Allows attacking a target two squares (6'/2m) away. 
* **Very long Reach**: Allows attacking a target three squares (9'/3m) away. 
* **Range Only**: Implies a weapon cannot be used against any targets adjacent to self. 
* **Prefer Range**: +2 **Ob** to using the weapon against an adjacent target.
* **Slow Reload**: Reloading the weapon costs 1 [AP](#action-points-ap).
* **Very Slow Reload**: Reloading the weapon costs 2 [AP](#action-points-ap).
* **Ranged (throwable: < attack name >)**: No damage penalty is incurred when throwing this type of weapon. The damage formula for the given attack is to be used on hit. 
* A **counter-attack** is a *reaction* that allows a fighter being attacked to attack their attacker. 

## Character Creation
Imagine for the longest time of their life, your character has led an ordinary existence, until one day, something life-changing happened. Perhaps something terrible, perhaps something wonderful, but something significant that has forced them out of their comfort zone into a world full of adventure. 

Creating an interesting and life-like character is a challenging, but ultimately, very rewarding task. Thinking of their existence up to the point they start adventuring, can really help with paving the path of their future and give you a good idea of what they're like, and why.

If you don't feel inspired, the following sections can provide tips and randomization tables that allow you write up a character more quickly. 

The procedure of creating a character consists of the following steps:
1. [Determine life path](#determine-life-path). 
2. [Determine species, sex & appearance](#species-sex--appearance).
3. [Determine name](#determine-name).
4. [Determine abilities](#determine-abilities).
6. [Determine **carrying capacity** and **assets**](#determine-assets).
7. [Determine **Max HP** and **Injury Maximum**](#determine-max-hp--injury-maximum)
8. [Determine exhaustion threshold](#determine-exhaustion-threshold).

### Determine Life Path
Where and when does the story of your character begin? Under what circumstances are they born and how were they raised? Until adulthood, did they lead a life of carelessness or did they have to fight for every scrap of food? How did they lead their life up until the point they picked up adventuring? 

Answering these questions will help you figure out what your character could be like, as a person and what kinds of **ambitions**, **aspirations** and **reactions** they might develop. 

If you need inspiration, the following tables might help a spark along:
#### Origin
| Range **D6** | Origin | 
| -------- | ------ |
| 1 | You were born into the life of a noble. |
| 2 | You were born as the only child of a merchant. |
| 3 | You were found as an orphaned infant and grew up in the hands of a kind foster family. |
| 4 | You were found as an abandoned infant at the doors to an orphanage. |
| 5 | You were born as the fifth child of a farmer. |
| 6 | You were born to a craftsman. |

#### Youth
| Range **D10** | Youth | 
| --------- | --------- |
| 1 | You developed a passion for a craft and found a master willing to teach you his art. |
| 2 | You never quite found your place in the world and never found a passion for honest work. Instead, you took to a life of lowly crime, pickpocketing and extorting what you could. |
| 3 | You spent much time with books and scrolls, reading about the world and its wonders. |
| 4 | You were drafted into the military and remained in service for a few years. |
| 5 | You went where the wind took you, doing lowly hireling pay when necessary and otherwise exploring and enjoying life as it came. |
| 6 | You preferred life in the wilderniss and either took to the hermit's life or simply camped out in the woods as much as possible. |
| 7 | You were wrongfully imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit. Or, perhaps, you did? |
| 8 | You, by chance, met a wise mentor, who sensed your lust for power. They taught you their knowledge, in secret, whenever they were available. |
| 9 | You found yourself wanting to better the world. You helped others where possible and eventually picked up on the healing arts, perhaps even learning under a tutor. |
| 10 | You were taught by a wealthy and successful merchant (perhaps your parent) and helped with running their business for a few years. |

#### The Last Few Years
| Range **D6** | The Last Few Years | 
| -------- | --------- |
| 1 | You made an enemy you couldn't beat and were thus forced to leave town. Since then, you've been on the run. |
| 2 | You've been given an important task to carry out in secret. A piece of parchment holds your orders, but the task is simply too great for you to complete on your own. |
| 3 | You've found yourself with an insatiable curiosity and decided to go see the world and its wonders. |
| 4 | You decided to go on a pilgrimage, but were distracted from your path. |
| 5 | You swore an oath and intend to keep it. You swore to rescue someone, or bring honor to your clan, or perhaps to bring justice to a known criminal. |
| 6 | You lost someone or something you held dear. Now, you're on a quest to get it back, or your revenge. |

### Determine Name
Any interesting character should have an interesting name. Whether you set a name or personality first, is entirely up to you. Although, you might prefer to delay this step until much later, once you've determined the other aspects of your character. Whichever you find easier is fine. 

If you can't come up with a name, you can ask your **GM** for inspiration, since they'll likely know the world and the culture(s) your character can stem from and what kinds of names are common there. 

### Species, Sex & Appearance
Species is a bit difficult to provide a randomization table for, because the world your **GM** is running, might have different species available, that could not be anticipated here. For simplicity's sake, it is assumed you are generating a human. 

Gender is personal preference, but could also be decided by a die. 

The following table provides appearance traits for you to pick via the roll of a **D10**. 

| Range **D10** | Physique    | Face       | Skin       | Hair     |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1         | Athletic    | Bloated    | Rough      | Bald     |
| 2         | Brawny      | Blunt      | Birthmark  | Braided  |
| 3         | Corpulent   | Bony       | Makeup     | Curly    |
| 4         | Delicate    | Chiseled   | Tattooed   | Cropped  |
| 5         | Gaunt       | Delicate   | Weathered  | Frizzy   |
| 6         | Hulking     | Elongated  | Perfect    | Long     |
| 7         | Lanky       | Patrician  | Tanned     | Ponytail |
| 8         | Stout       | Pinched    | War Paint  | Oily     |
| 9         | Short       | Narrow     | Pale       | Wavy     |
| 10        | Scrawny     | Broken     | Pierced    | Greased  |

### Determine Personality
Perhaps more important than a name, is the personality that it represents. Think about what you want your character to be like - are they very sociable? Or perhaps a taciturn brute who'd rather let their actions speak? A cruel man of science? A socialite with friends everywhere? The options are plentiful!

Refer to the table in the [personality traits](#personality-traits) section. You can choose freely, where to place your "x", for every row. You can even leave every trait at "undecided" and find out through play what your character is like. If you prefer, you can even let chance decide for you! For that, roll a **D6** for every row. A 0 results in a "signature" trait on the left side of the scale, while a 6 results in a "signature" trait on the right side of the scale. Using this method, you will **not** have *any* "undecided" traits in the end. 

#### Determine Ambition, Aspirations & Reactions
This is where things may get a little difficult. Work together with your **GM**, as they know their world and what kinds of agendas the people in it might have. 

Don't worry too much about your first **aspirations** and **reactions**, as they're expected to change frequently and through the events your character has yet to experience. 

Only your **ambition** will require some thought beforehand, but even so, you don't have to plan your character's entire future, at all. But keep in mind that your character's **ambition** tells your **GM**, what kind of stories you'd like to explore and what's more, how your character will fit into them. Again, working with your **GM** to determine a fitting **ambition** is paramount. 

##### Choosing an Ambition
At the core of every character stands their [ambition](#ambition), which is the primary force driving them. A good **ambition** should last you a long time and give the **GM** a hint what kind of story you want to explore with your character. 

Talk to your **GM** about the **ambition** you want your character to have. On the one hand, it allows them to determine the kind of story you want to explore and on the other hand they can guage whether the **ambition** is a suitable long-term goal. 

Keep in mind the **ambition** you can randomly determine here is kept most basic and generic. Work with your **GM** to fill in the details. 

| Range **D10** | Ambition           |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 1         | Revenge            |
| 2         | Pilgrimage         |
| 3         | Wealth             |
| 4         | Power              |
| 5         | Fame/Glory         |
| 6         | Knowledge          |
| 7         | Family & Belonging |
| 8         | Atonement          |
| 9         | Altruism           |
| 10        | Fire               |

##### Choosing Aspirations
Now, the time to determine your three [aspirations](#aspiration) has come. Yet again, your **GM** is integral in finding them. However, the other **PC**s are also of interest now. You can have **aspirations** whose subject is one of the other **PC**s. You could even have the game begin with two or more of the **PC**s knowing each other, this way. 

> Two **PC**s begin the game knowing each other. One starts with a background as a criminal, the other as a former monk. The former monk has an **aspiration** stating "Stealing isn't right! I will help my friend pick up honest work!" The thief, on the other hand has the **aspiration** "My friend has my back, but they really need to start looking after themselves! I will teach them to be more like me." 
> 
> These two **aspirations** allow these characters to come into conflict, despite their good intentions. How it will play out, no one can say. And that makes for an interesting conflict!

##### Choosing Reactions
Lastly, you need three [reactions](#reaction) for your character. Ideally, at least one of them should allow your **GM** getting your **PC** into *trouble*. 

For reactions, you're fairly free to pick and choose, so long as you keep in mind that **reactions** cannot alter facts of the narrative. **Reactions** can only allow you to *enter* a situation with an advantage - or to get your character in trouble in a situation that triggers it. 

> A reaction like "Allies around me don't die" is a bad **reaction**, as it tries to alter facts, but isn't allowed to. The **GM** can't do much with this kind of reaction. 
>
> An improved version would be "Whenever an ally near me is in trouble, I come to their aid". 

### Determine Abilities
Next up, you can reinforce your character's [personality](#personality) with the abilities they have. Or even prepare a conflict of what your character *can* do and what they *think* they can do. 

#### Choosing Attributes
There are two methods for determining your character's attributes: manual and semi-random. 

Please keep in mind the values here are representative for an ordinary human about to enter an adventuring life. Other species may have modifiers on their attributes, making them better or worse in some of them. But that depends on the world your **GM** is running. 

##### Manual Attribute Assignment
* You can spend **16 points** on your attributes. 
* All attributes start at level 1. 
* Your attribute-total cannot be greater than **26**.
* No attribute may have a level less than 1 nor higher than 4.
* Only two attributes may have a level of 4. 

##### Semi-Random Attribute Assignment
 1. Roll 10 **D4**
1. Row up your dice to form a line, then read them from one end to the other and note each value. The order in which they are written down, is the order in which they'll be applied to the attributes. 
2. If there are more than 2 4s, start lowering their value by one, starting from the left or the right, until there are only 2 4s left. 
3. Count up the total of your values. 
   1. Subtract your total from **23**.
   2. If the number is negative, that's the number of levels you'll have to go down. <br>
   If the number is positive, that's the number of levels you'll have to go up. 
4. Starting from the left or right, start adjusting each value.
   1. If your levels have to go down, subtract one from each value. **But** skip 1s. 
   2. If your levels have to go up, add one to each value. But **don't** skip 4s. 
5. Repeat from the step of counting up your total and adjusting as necessary, until no more adjustments are necessary. 
6. Lastly, apply the adjusted values to your attributes. 

##### Determine Attribute Advancing Thresholds
Once attribute values have been set, you can determine the required number of successes and failures each attribute requires, in order to advance. 

For this, see the rules on [attribute advancing](#advancing-attributes).

#### Choosing Skills
You can spend **8** points to *learn* skills and raise their level, with the following limitations:
* No skill can be higher level than 3. 
* You can have at most 7 skills. 
* No skills can be set to *learning*.

Once you've chosen skills, you can determine the required number of successes and failures each skill requires, in order to advance. 

For this, see the rules on [skill advancing](#advancing-skills).

### Determine Assets
In most cases, your character will have left home with their everyday clothes and some of their **property**. 

First, determine your character's [worn & equipped assets](#worn--equipped). Every slot may be filled, but keep in mind your character's background. Someone with the background of a peasant is unlikely to wear a crown, for example. 

Then, determine your character's [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity). Refer to the [strength](#strength-str) attribute to do so. Once you have this number, you know how much [luggage](#luggage) your character can carry around. Again, your character's background should dictate what kinds of things and how many they should have. 

Always make sure to talk to your **GM** and fellow players and have them agree to the **assets** you want your character to start with. 

### Determine Max HP & Injury Maximum
Determine your character's **max HP** and **injury limit**, by referring to the [toughness](#toughness-tough) attribute. 

All characters start with an **injury limit** of 2. 

### Determine Exhaustion Threshold
Determine your character's [exhaustion threshold](#exhaustion), by referring to the [endurance](#endurance-end) attribute. 

# Fate Points
Fate points (**FP**) represent a meta-currency that *players* can earn and use to buy boons for their character or the group as a whole. 

There are three types of **FP**: [Minor](#minor-fate-points), [major](#major-fate-points) and [ambition](#ambition-fate-points). 

**FP** are earned, by playing to the character's [personality](#personality). Most **FP** are earned by a single player, but some may also be earned by the players as a group. 

## Minor Fate Points
**Minor Fate Points (MiFP)** are the lowest valued and most common type of **FP**, most commonly earned by playing the mechanics of the game. 

**MiFP** can be earned in the following ways: 
* **Personality**: Playing in accordance to one's **personality traits**. 
* **Aspiration**: Playing to one's **aspirations**. This only counts *working towards* an **aspiration**. 
* **Trouble**: Playing to one's **reactions** - if they get their character, or their allies, into trouble. 
* **Humor**: Stopping the table with a good bit of humor at the right time. But don't overdo it - your **GM** can only weave you a dramatic and gripping story, if you let them. 
* **Specialist**: Driving the story forward, when no one else could - having the right skill to employ at the right time. 
* **Helper**: Helping an ally out at a *critical* time - during or out of [combat](#combat). 

## Major Fate Points
**Major Fate Points (MaFP)** take more effort from the *player* to earn, only being earned through convincing roleplaying, creative efforts and accomplishing long-term goals. 

**MaFP** can be earned in the following ways: 
* **Aspiration**: Accomplishing an **aspiration**, achieving its goal. 
* **Achievements**: Whenever a major plot point or story arc is concluded - a great journey, uncovering a plot of assassination, fulfilling a contract to clear out a bandit camp or discovering an ancient artifact, all count as *achievements*, which earn this award **for all the players, as a group**. 
* **Embodiment**: Capturing their character and personifying them, in the moment. For example, by giving a great speech, acting scared or enjoying a bitter revenge with glee, as if they were actually there and doing it! 
* **Inner Turmoil**: Convincingly acting out an inner conflict that may come up when a decision conflicts with an **aspiration** or **personality trait**. If the others can *feel* the gut-wrenching decision being made, this award is **earned**!
* **Creative Solutions**: Coming up with a very creative way to solve a problem. This may be a diplomatic solution, where the **GM** thought one impossible. Or, perhaps an unexpected use of the environment during **combat**, which yielded the **PC**s a distinct advantage on the battlefield, in a way the **GM** didn't foresee. 
* **Collaboration**: Working with the **GM** to further the world and the story in creative ways and helping the **GM** out when possible. Secret plots that only one of the players is involved in, which causes gasps and applause from the other players, when the plot is finally revealed, for example. 
* **The Gears**: Being *the gears*, without which nothing would move. Doing the laborious work during session, nobody wants to do, but which has to happen to keep the story moving. Always making sure to pitch the tents in the right spot, watching out for traps or doing the boring question-asking all earn this award!

## Ambition Fate Points
**Ambition Fate Points (AFP)** are very rare and only earned through outstanding achievements. 

**AFP** can be earned in the following ways: 
* **World-Shaper**: Changing the world around oneself in a significant way. 
* **Selfless**: Going above and beyond to achieve something, a betterment, not for oneself, but for others and at great cost. 
* **Achiever**: Achieving and thus concluding an **ambition**. 

## Hand of Fate
The **Hand of Fate** is a deck of cards a player can draw from, using their **FP** as currency to buy cards. 

A player can play any of their cards whenever appropriate. A played card is discarded. 

There are no limits to how many of a given card a player can own, but they may only hoard a maximum of 5 cards at a time. 

| Cost    | Name               | Effect             |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 3 MiFP  | Single Re-Roll     | Repeat a single test you just made. |
| 6 MiFP  | Clotter            | One **active** [injury](#injury) of choice is now **patched up**. |
| 1 MaFP  | Cascading Re-Roll  | Repeat a single test you just made. With this card, you keep any **positives** you achieved from the previously made test and add them to the **positives** rolled when you repeat the test. |
| 1 MaFP  | Fact Check         | Change a minor plot point in a way your prefer. Work with your **GM** to make sure it fits the narrative, but they should respect your wish. This could be something like avoiding an **NPC** death or changing a fact about the plot. |
| 1 MaFP  | Just a Flesh Wound | Remove or avoid one non-permanent [injury](#injury) of choice. |
| 1 MaFP  | Hastened           | +1 **AP** during your turns for the entirety of a [combat](#combat) encounter. |
| 5 MaFP  | Double the Fun     | Double the number of dice to roll on your next/current test. |
| 10 MaFP | Wrong Diagnosis    | Remove or avoid one permanent [injury](#injury) of choice. |
| 1 AFP   | Defy Death         | Leap from [death's door](#deaths-door), remove 1 **active** [injury](#injury) of choice and be at 1 **HP**; Alternatively, avoid a narratively-driven death. The **GM** will decide the character's alternative fate. They could be captured, very badly injured or become indebted to someone or something. |
| 1 AFP   | Yes, my liege      | Work with your **GM** to create a follower/hireling who will now be at your command/employ. |

# Time-Management
The speed at which time flows, in-game, is variable and depends on the current circumstances of the narrative. 

There are two broad disctinctions of time-flow made: 
* [Down-time](#down-time) has time flowing very rapidly, as events unfold on a fairly abstract level. 
* [scenario-time](#scenario-time) has time flowing very slowly, sometimes even on a second-by-second basis, as the way events unfold must be carefully considered. 

There will be times when the order in which characters act matters. For this, see the [initiative](#initiative) section. Most often, though, **PC**s will act at irregular times, depending on circumstance. 

## Initiative
When the order in which characters act matters, rolls for **initiative** are needed. **Initiative** is the number that determines when a character should get a chance to act. 

The **initiative** of all involved parties is collected and sorted, which forms the so called **initiative order**. The first character in the **initiative order** gets to act first, then the character after them gets to act and so on. Higher **initiative** allows for an earlier turn. 

The steps to determine the **initiatve order** are as follows: 
1. Every character who rolls for **initiative**, must do so with a **D10**. 
2. They add their [base initiative](#base-initiative) to the number they rolled. 
3. If two characters achieve the same number, they must each roll a **D10** again, until one of the numbers is higher. The character with the higher number gets to act before the other. 
4. The result, is their place in the **initiative order**.
5. A higher **initiative** results in an earlier **turn** while lower **initiative** results in a later **turn**. 

The point in time when a character gets to act (or abstain from their action) is called their **turn**. When all characters have had their **turn**, a **round** is concluded. After that, the first person in the **initiative order** gets to act again and a new **round** is begun. This cycle continues, until **initiative order** is no longer needed. 

A character can abstain from their action willingly. They get a final chance to act at the end of the **round**. They can abstain from that action, too, which ends the **round** for them. Then, in the next **round**, their time to act is back to what the **initiative order** dictates. If multiple characters abstain from their action, they'll get another chance at the end of a **round**, in the same order they normally would have. In other words, the last character to abstain from their action is the last person to get another chance at the end of a **round**. 

Most prominently, **initiative order** is used during [combat](#combat). But it could also find application during other times, such as a chase-sequence, negotiations, or during [down-time](#down-time). **Initiative** could even be used on a more abstract level, to determine in what order characters get to try out their political schemes. The concrete instances when **initiative** is to be used, will be up to the **GM** to decide. 

### Surprise Round
If one party is surprised, for example during an ambush, then the ambushing party gets to act for a full **round**, without the ambushed party getting a chance to act. This is called a **surprise round**. After the **surprise round** **initiative** is handled as normal. 

To determine whether a **round** is a **surprise round**, proceed with the following steps:
1. Determine **awareness** with [perception](#perception-perc) rolls. 
   1. The **Ob** to use is up to circumstance. When choosing the **Ob**, keep in mind that pure [attribute](#attributes) rolls cannot be forked! Even just **Ob** 3 would be a difficult to succeed [test](#tests). 
2. If no one in the surprised party could clearly see, hear or perhaps even smell the fight coming and none of them succeeded their **awareness** test, they are considered **surprised**.

> **Surprise round** does not apply to opponents standing right in front of each other in conversation, when one of them suddenly draws a dagger and attacks. The attacker can be clearly seen by the defender (assuming they can see) and thus does not result in a **surprise round**. Of course, the specifics are always up to the scenario at hand and to the **GM**'s ruling. 

## Down-Time
When not currently dealing with events on a detailed level - there and in the moment - **PC**'s can spend their time on a more abstract level. This applies especially to activities that take greater amounts of time, such as recovering from injuries, travel, engaging in their trade, honing their [skill](#skills) and so on. 

### Travel
People travel around the world all the time, for the most diverse reasons. Be they a trade caravan on the move between cities, a pilgrim on the way to a holy site, a craftsman going to town to sell their crafts, a roaming mercenary or a mother visiting their children - everyone has to spend time, travelling. 

How much time it takes, exactly, to get from *A* to *B*, depends heavily on the *distance* to and the *means* of travel. If horses are the fastest means of transportation, expect to be travelling across countries for days if not weeks. But if means of instantaneous teleportation makes travel a trivial issue, then you might not even need to consider it, at all. These details are strongly tied to your **GM**'s world, so they'll ultimately be the one to determine your travel times. 

If there is a world map, the **GM** could overlay it with tiles of squares or hexagons, which may help with determining distance. If your group desires, you could even play it so that your characters only travel from tile to tile. Moving from one tile to another may then always take a set time, unless faster means of travel are available. That way, travel would be simplified and abstract. But discuss with your group, whether you want to play it this way. Travel may also provide interesting opportunities for role-playing and *conflicts*. The abstract level draws attention away from these opportunities. 

### Crafting
All [craftsmanship skills](#craftsmanship) require a time investment proportional to the *quality* and *complexity* of the desired product, as well as the innate *effort* required to create it. 

Making use of a [craftsmanship skill](#craftsmanship) to create something requires a [graduated test](#graduated-test) be made. The number of dice in play dictate both the time required and the maximum achievable quality. Each [skill](#skills) in question notes how much time one die "costs". It is possible to roll with fewer dice, than would be available for the [graduated test](#graduated-test). [Forked skills](#skill-forking) can also provide a die each, but note that *every* die, including those from [forked skills](#skill-forking), increase the time required. The number of **positives** and **negatives** achieved has no effect on the time taken. Merely the *number* of dice that were rolled matters. 

Most **skills** do not allow for failure and the outcome of the test simply denotes the achieved quality of the product. But there are some **skills**, which can be failed, entirely. In such a case, an **Ob** threshold will be noted. Failing to achieve more **positives** than the **Ob**, will result in a **complete failure** of the test - there is no resulting product and the materials used are wasted. 

The number of **positives** achieved denote the quality that has been achieved. Note this number on the product. 1-2 **positives** result in a **poor**, 3-4 in an **average**, 5 in a **good**, 6 in an **excellent** and 7+ in a **masterwork** product.

Also keep in mind that to craft anything, you must have the materials required. The [craftsmanship skill](#craftsmanship) in question will provide an overview of the kinds of products you can make and what they require. Note, however, that things are kept vague on purpose. No encyclopedic listing of all possible products and required materials can be found, because such lists could never completely encompass the full spectrum of creativity available. The things listed on the skills are only meant to provide guidance. So, be creative and have your **GM** help you figure out what you need to make your product. 

Depending on how easy to acquire the materials are, you may act on a more abstract level and "go shopping", simply spending the time and money required up front, without turning it into a scene or adventure of its own, that must be played out. Of course, the more difficult to acquire materials may require you to *actually* go and find them. 

> For example, a **PC** might have decided they want to create an elaborately decorated piece of furniture, with bands of gold and colored glass inlays. Even though the [carpentry](#carpentry-agi) skill does not list gold as a material for its product, the **PC** should have to procure the gold, if they are to finish their piece of furniture. 

#### Crafting Time Chart
The following matrix denotes the time that work will take, based on its inherent *complexity* and *workload*. 

| **Complexity >** <br> **Workload v** | **Low** | **Moderate** | **High** | **Very High** | 
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | 
| **Low**       | 5 Minutes  | 15 Minutes | 1 Hour     | 1 Week     | 
| **Moderate**  | 10 Minutes | 1 Hour     | 1 Day      | 2 Weeks    | 
| **High**      | 30 Minutes | 12 Hours   | 3 Days     | 3 Weeks    | 
| **Very High** | 1 Hour     | 1 Day      | 1 Week     | 1 Month    | 

A **very high** complexity requires the work to be done in a highly specialized environment, with equally specialized tools. The other end of the spectrum is a **low** complexity, which describes work that can be done practically anywhere - even on the road - and with any tool at least somewhat fit for the job. 

Workload is the result of processes that naturally take a long time, the difficulty in processing materials and the amount of work that has to be done. A **very high** workload will take months to complete, while a **low** workload may be finished in a matter of minutes. 

### Trade
Selling and buying things can take a surprising amount of time. If prices are too high and demand or reputation too low, chances are, you won't be able to sell your goods. But even when people do show interest in your wares, you still have to *sell it* to them. An uncharismatic merchant will have a difficult time making a pretty profit, regardless of the quality of their goods. On the other hand, buying things may prove equally difficult, when what you're looking for isn't really available. 

For trade, there is really only one [skill](#skills) - the [mercantilism](#mercantilism-ora) skill. Using this [skill](#skills) requires a [graduated test](#graduated-test) with an **Ob** threshold to be made. The **degree of success** factors into getting a better price.

The number of dice in play for a [graduated test](#graduated-test) of this skill determine both the chance to successfully trade something and the time it takes to trade it. It is the **GM**'s duty to determine demand and supply of the thing being sold on the market, as well as how well known the **PC** is as a reputable trader. A low demand, coupled with a low reputation as a trader, should result in a high **Ob** for the test (such as a 4 or even 5). On the other hand, if demand is high, reputation might not matter much and result in a much lower **Ob**. 

It is possible to roll with fewer dice, than would be available for the [graduated test](#graduated-test). [Forked skills](#skill-forking) can also provide a die each, but note that *every* die, including those from [forked skills](#skill-forking), increase the time required. The number of **positives** and **negatives** achieved has no effect on the time taken. Merely the *number* of dice that were rolled matters. 

To get an ear on the ground and figure out what the local market is like, a character can spend 8 hours to walk around, talk to people, ask for prices of common goods and get a feel for the wealth of the local populace. 

#### Seller's Chart
The following matrix provides an overview of how long it may take to sell things on the market. Note that the **GM** has the final say on how long it will actually take and on how difficult it will be. 

Denoted are both the time it takes to get a chance at a [mercantilism](#mercantilism-ora) [test](#tests), what the **Ob** threshold is and what margins can be expected. The margins are relative to the goods' *listing price* or *normal* value. 200% means the goods can be sold at twice what they're worth. 

| **Supply >** <br> **Demand v** | **Very High** | **High** | **Moderate** | **Low** | 
| ------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Low**       | 4 Days <br> Ob 6 <br>  50%   | 3 Days <br> Ob 5 <br>  60%   | 2 Days <br> Ob 4 <br>  70%   | 1 Day <br> Ob 3 <br>  80%      |

### Buyer's Chart
The following matrix provides an overview of how long it may take to buy things on the market. Note that the **GM** has the final say on how long it will actually take and on how difficult it will be. 

Denoted are both the time it takes to get a chance at a [mercantilism](#mercantilism-ora) [test](#tests), what the **Ob** threshold is and what price inflation can be expected. The prices are relative to the goods' *listing price* or *normal* value. 200% means the goods must be bought at twice what they're worth. 

The supply is assumed to be relative to the demand. The more something is in demand, the more likely it is to be kept in stock and by more merchants, which makes it easier to find, even if there are more other buyers to compete with. 

| **Supply >** <br> **Demand v** | **Very High** | **High** | **Moderate** | **Low** | 
| ------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Low**       | 1 Day <br> Ob 0 <br>  50%      | 2 Days <br> Ob 1 <br>  60%   | 3 Days <br> Ob 2 <br>  70%    | 4 Days <br> Ob 3 <br>  80%   |

### Recovery
When [injured](#injury), a character should prepare to spend time away from adventure for a while. Since the process of healing up can take several weeks, this time is best handled abstractly with the other **PC**s going about their business during the same time. 

### Training
When not busy with work and adventure, **PC**s may train, in order to passively improve their [attributes](#practicing-attributes) or [skills](#practicing-skills). This time is usually best handled abstractly, by not playing out the details of the training. 

## Scenario-Time
In contrast to [down-time], scenario-time describes the point in the narrative when the PCs are dealing with a specific situation on a fine-grained level, where the amount of time that is spent matters. 

This is especially the case in scenarios of [combat](#combat), tense negotiation, risky exploration, survival and the like, where each individual step on the path matters as much as the path itself. 

There is also the distinction to be made whether the order in which characters act in matters. If it does, then the rules for [initiative](#initiative) must be used. [Combat](#combat) is the most prominent example of such a case. 

# Combat
When diplomacy fails, hostilities ensue. This is when the game enters into a state that is handled very carefully. How time is *sliced* and when characters get to act, is crucial. 

The steps to *prepare* for combat are as follows:
1. Determine **awareness** with [perception](#perception-perc) rolls. 
   1. Sometimes, not everyone may be immediately aware of a fight breaking out. This is usually the case when characters cannot clearly see, hear or perhaps even smell a fight breaking out. 
   2. The **Ob** to use is up to circumstance. When choosing the **Ob**, keep in mind that pure [attribute](#attributes) rolls cannot be [forked](#skill-forking)! Even at just **Ob** 3, a [test](#tests) would be difficult to succeed. 
2. Determine if there is a [surprise round](#surprise-round). 
   1. If no one in the party could clearly see, hear or perhaps even smell the fight coming and none of them succeeded their [perception](#perception-perc) [test](#tests), they are considered **surprised**.
   2. Only the first **round** of combat can be a [surprise round](#surprise-round). 
3. Determine [Initiative order](#initiative). 
   1. Before any action during a combat scenario can be taken, [Initiative order](#initiative) must first be determined. 
   2. This includes *everyone*, not just the active combatants. This way, should anyone join the fight, they're easier to work into the [initiative order](#initiative). Or, if they stay out of the fight, it's easier to determine when they get to act out-of-combat. 

During combat, when a character gets their **turn**, they can choose to perform an action. How many actions they get to perform, depends on the [action points](#action-points-ap) they have available for that turn. 

Active actions during combat are:
* [Attacking](#attacking)
  * [Throwing](#throwing)
  * [Unarmed combat](#unarmed-combat-str)
* [Moving](#combat-movement)
  * [Disengaging](#disengage)
  * [Swapping out](#swap-out)
* Speaking
* Waiting (= abstaining from an action)

Reactions during combat are:
* [Attacks of Opportunity](#attacks-of-opportunity)
* [Defending](#defending)
  * [Defending an ally](#defending-an-ally)

Combat ends, when neither side has the ability or will left to fight. At this point, **initiative order** will oftentimes no longer be needed. 

## Action Points (AP)
Every **turn**, every character gets 3 **Action Points (AP)** to spend on actions during their **turn**. Some [skills](#skills), [boons and penalties](#boons--penalties) can alter this number. 

At the start of a combat encounter, **all characters** start with 3 **AP**. After that, **AP** are only regained per-character, upon the start of their turn. 

* Any basic action, that is, any action not requiring a [test](#tests), costs 1 **AP**. 
  * Speaking or shouting a short phrase is free. If you want to have a proper conversation, that will cost you one or more **AP**, depending on how much you have to say. 
  * [Basic movement](#combat-movement) counts as a basic action. 
  * Handing an object over to a character adjacent to you, is a basic action (assuming you don't have to force it on them). 
  * Pulling something from your bag or getting a weapon ready (from your back, scabbard or wherever you keep it) also counts as a movement action and costs 1 **AP**. 
* Any action requiring a [test](#tests), costs 2 **AP**. 
* [Skill abilities](#skill-abilities) can cost varying amounts of **AP**. The exact number will be noted on the [skill ability](#skill-abilities) in question. 

### Action Point Saving
If a character ends their **turn** with any **AP** unspent, those **AP** will be saved up and be available as additional **AP** at the start of their next **turn**. 

Until the start of their next **turn**, they can keep up to 5 **AP**, which they can use for [active defense](#defending) during other character turns. 

At the start of their next **turn**, only up to 2 of the saved **AP** transfer to this next **turn**. This means a character can normally start their next **turn** with at most 5 **AP**. 

It may be possible to go past this limit via some [skill abilities](#skill-abilities) or [boons](#boons--penalties). 

> Assuming a character has 4 unspent **AP** at the end of their **turn**, and they are attacked, they can use one of those **AP** to actively defend themselves. This costs them 1 **AP**, meaning they still have 3 unspent **AP**. 
>
> At the start of their next **turn**, they get to keep 2 of those unspent **AP** and are forced to discard the other 1 **AP**. Thus, they begin their turn with 5 **AP** available to them. 

## Combat Movement
A character can move up to **12'/4m** (= 4 fields on a grid) per **AP** spent. In **difficult terrain**, the distance moved per **AP** is half that, at **6'/2m** (= 2 fields on a grid). 

**Difficult terrain** is any space that slows movement, but does not prevent it outright. Examples would be waist-high water, a surface of glue or a slowing force field. 

It is also possible to **sprint**, doubling the distance one can move per **AP**, but at the cost of 1 point of [exhaustion](#exhaustion) for every **AP** spent **sprinting**. 

### Swap-Out
It is possible to swap positions with an adjacent ally, without provoking an [attack of opportunity](#attacks-of-opportunity) for either character. 

This **action** costs 3 [AP](#action-points-ap). 

The ally in question can **oppose** this action with [strength](#strength-str). 

### Disengage
It is possible to move out of or through an enemy's **range of opportunity** without provoking an [attack of opportunity](#attacks-of-opportunity). This action costs 2 [AP](#action-points-ap). 

When disengaging from or pushing through more than one **range of opportunity** in the same action, every additional **range of opportunity** past the first adds 1 [AP](#action-points-ap) cost. 

## Attacking
Attacks are made using a [skill ability](#skill-abilities) of a [weapon](#weapon--weapon-type--str), the [unarmed](#unarmed-combat-str) or [throwing](#throwing-agi) [skill](#skills). 

An attack generally requires an [opposed test](#opposed-test) to be made. If the attacker wins, the full [damage](#damage) is applied to the defender. 

In case of an [aoe](#area-of-effect-aoe) attack, a defender may be able to halve the [damage](#damage) (rounded up), if they win the [opposed test](#opposed-test). 

### Damage
Damage dealt to an opponent reduces their **HP**. When their **HP** reaches 0, they suffer an [injury](#injury) and their HP is reset to their new maximum. To determine the new maximum, see the [injury](#injury) section. 

If more damage is dealt, than the difference to 0, that damage is also dealt. Damage isn't lost - it overflows into the next **HP** *segment*. 

What type of [injury](#injury) is dealt, also depends on the [damage type](#damage-types). 

### Attack Modifiers
Sometimes, special circumstances apply, which make certain attacks easier or harder to land. 

#### Aimed Attack
An attack generally targets the center of mass (torso) of the targeted opponent. 

It is, however, possible to call out wanting to attack a specific part of an opponent's body. Generally, this means that the attack must be rolled at greater **Ob**. However, the **GM** can also decide the part being targeted is fairly easy to hit, either generally or due to current circumstance, so no disadvantage is incurred. 

A player may call out what effect the aimed attack is supposed to have, such as limiting their opponent's ability to stand, move, attack or whatever else the body part may be useful for. If they don't, the **GM** decides the effect. 

#### Easy Attack
Some attacks may be easier to perform. An **easy attack** has a lower **Ob**.

The following are generally considered easy attacks (but at the **GM**'s discretion):
* From behind
* Against prone opponents
* Against restrained opponents

#### Execution Attack
The extreme version of an easy attack, the **execution attack** allows outright killing or maiming an opponent, without having to roll for an attack or for [damage](#damage). 

Such an attack can be carried out against any character who is unable to resist (with the exception of player characters, see [death's door](#deaths-door)). 

> An **unconscious** character, or one chained to the wall couldn't possibly resist and can be instantaneously killed with an **execution attack**. 

This kind of attack is only possible at the **GM**'s discretion. 

### Attacks of Opportunity
When a character is within weapon's reach of another hostile character, they're considered within the other's **range of opportunity**. Whenever a character in an enemy's **range of opportunity** moves away from or more than 2m/6' around that enemy, that enemy can **choose to perform an attack of opportunity**. It is possible to avoid an **attack of opportunity** with a [disengage](#disengage) combat action. 

Performing an **attack of opportunity** costs 1 [AP](#action-points-ap) at a **-1D** penalty and will **halt** the enemy in question and prevent their movement, regardless of whether the attack lands. The attacked party can still choose to push past, thus still getting to move, but if they do, the **attack of opportunity** is **guaranteed** to land successfully, without any attack [test](#tests) necessary. 

An **attack of opportunity** is a **combat action** and a **reaction**. 

## Defending
There are two types of defense:
* **Active defense**: Costs 1 [AP](#action-points-ap) and uses all available dice for the [test](#tests). 
  * This defense can only happen as a *reaction* and a deliberate choice, during another character's turn. 
  * **Stunts** are possible. 
* **Passive defense**: Does not cost any [AP](#action-points-ap), but uses only half (rounded down) of the available dice for the [test](#tests).
  * This defense happens automatically, if no **active defense** is attempted. 
  * This defense can *not* be used against attacks that cost more than 1 [AP](#action-points-ap) to defend against. 
  * **Stunts** are *not* possible. 

To defend, an [opposed test](#opposed-test) must be made. If successful, the attack is negated, entirely. Depending on the defense skill in question ([melee defense](#melee-defence-agi) or [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi)), the [degree of success](#graduated-test) may allow additional effects (called **stunts**) to happen. But if the attacker wins, they get to roll for and apply [damage](#damage) to the defender. 

Defending against [area of effect](#area-of-effect) attacks is *only* possible as a **passive defense** and can *not* negate the attack. It can only halve (rounded up) its [damage](#damage). 

### Cover
It is possible for characters to hide behind stationary things to make it harder to hit them. This mostly applies to ranged combat, but may also find use in melee, depending on circumstance. 

There are two categories of cover: 
* **Low cover**: +1 **Ob** against a target that is behind low cover. 
  * Low cover is any static object to hide behind that doesn't fully cover the body, like a tree stump or low wall. 
* **High cover**: +2 **Ob** against a target that is behind high cover. 
  * High cover is any static object to hide behind that fully covers the body, like a tall wall or large boulder. 

### Defending an Ally
It is possible for a character to defend an adjacent ally when they're being attacked. This costs 2 [AP](#action-points-ap) and results in the ally taking over the defense being forced to roll the defence test, instead of the originally attacked character. 

Defending an ally is a **combat action** and a **reaction**. 

## Throwing
Throwing things is a special type of action, that follows the rules outlined below. 

### Throwing-Distance
**The maximum distance** something can be thrown is determined by the object's [bulk](#bulk) and the character's [strength](#strength-str):
* For every point in [strength](#strength-str), an object can be thrown an additional **15'/5m**. 
* For every point in bulk past 1, the [strength](#strength-str) value for throwing is reduced by 1. 

The steps to determine **distance** to throw are as follows:
1. Reduce the object's [bulk](#bulk) by 1. 
2. Reduce [strength](#strength-str) by the remaining [bulk](#bulk). 
3. Multiply by 15'/5m. 

> A character with [strength](#strength-str) 1 can throw an object of [bulk](#bulk) 1 up to 15'/5m and cannot throw an object of bulk 2 or higher, at all. 
> 
> A character with [strength](#strength-str) 5 can throw an object of [bulk](#bulk) 1 up to 75'/25m and an object of [bulk](#bulk) 3 up to 45'/15m. 

### Throwing-Accuracy
How likely the object is to impact where intended is determined by the object's [bulk](#bulk), the distance to throw and the character's skill in the [throwing](#throwing-agi) skill.
* For every **15'/5m** interval, the **Ob** increases by 1. 
  * That means up to 15'/5m is **Ob** 1. Starting at 18'/6m, up to and including 30'/10m it's **Ob** 2. Starting at 33'/11m, it's **Ob** 3, and so on.

The steps to determine **Ob** to throw are as follows:
1. Divide distance to throw by 15'/5m.
2. Round up.

> A character with [agility](#agility-agi) 1 must succeed a test at **Ob** 1 for a distance of 15'/5m. They must succeed a test at **Ob** 2 for a distance of 18'/6m and a test at **Ob** 3 for a distance of 33'/11m. 

In case of an unsuccessful throw, the object lands only near the intended spot, instead of on it. In order to determine where a missed throw lands, roll a **D8**. A 1 designates the object landed north-west of the intended spot. Then, going clock-wise, a 2 would designate north, 3 north-east and so on. 

Note, that in case a spot determined this way would be farther than the character can throw, you must correct the distance by moving it closer towards the character that threw the object, until it is within their allowed distance. 

For your convenience, you can refer to the following chart: 

<img src="../../img/miss-chart.png" width="384px" height="384px"></img>

### Throwing-Damage
If throwing a weapon that isn't specifically made or especially suitable to throwing, then the damage that is dealt on successful hit is halved (rounded down). 

When throwing non-weapons, the damage dealt is calculated the following way: [strength](#strength-str) * [bulk](#bulk)

The [damage type](#damage-types) to use, depends on the type of object and how it hits the target. For most non-weapons, **bludgeoning** will be appropriate. 

> A character with [strength](#strength-str) 5, throwing a [bulk](#bulk) 3 object, can deal 5 * 3 = 15 points of damage. 

## Unarmed Combat (Str)
Sometimes, your own body is your greatest weapon. Fists and feet can cause a surprising amount of damage. 

* Melee
* This is a skill

| Skill | **Ob**  | Attack                  | AP | Damage                | Effect |
| ----- | ------- | ----------------------- | -- | --------------------- | ------ |
| 0     | Opposed by [Melee Defence](#melee-defence-agi) | Punch, kick, headbutt   | 2  | **Str** + 2 **Bludgeoning** | / |
| 0     | Opposed by [Melee Defence](#melee-defence-agi) | Shove                   | 2  | Push an enemy away from you for 3'/1m. | Enemy is within melee reach. | / |
| 1     | Opposed by **Unarmed Combat**                  | Grapple                 | 2  | If **completely successful**, the target is unable to move and suffers **-1D** to their defense tests, for as long as they're grappled. Someone grappled can attempt to break free with an opposed **Unarmed Combat** test, on their turn. The grappler can not use at least one of their hands for as long as they're grappling. |
| 2     | Opposed by **Unarmed Combat**                  | Wrestle and Disarm      | 2  | Perform a [single target](#single) attack against a designated enemy. If you win, you disarm them and could wrestle them to the ground, making them [prone](#prone), if you so choose. | Disarm only if enemy is using detachable weapon. |
| 3     | Opposed by [strength](#strength-str)           | Barge in                | 3  | Push back an enemy within melee reach and take their position. | Enemy is within melee reach. | 

# Appendix
The appendix contains important and less important lists, for reference only when needed. 

## Lists of Skills
The following list does not and cannot aim to be a complete listing of all possible skills in game. Adding new skills as necessary will have to be done by the **GM**. 

### Physical Skills
These skills have a dominant physical aspect and are directly tied to a character's *physical attributes*. 

#### Acrobatics (Agi)
Performing acrobatic feats, such as jumping and climbing, without injuring oneself in the process. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | **Ob**  | Effect(s)          | Condition(s) |
| ----- | -------------------- | -- | ------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| 3     | Wind Out Of It       | 0  | /       | When hit by a [single-target](#single-target-st) attack, wind out of the hit and suffer only half the damage. | Once per combat. |
| 4     | Bob, Weave, Jab      | 0  | Opposed | When succeeding a [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) test, follow up with a [single-target](#single-target-st) attack against the enemy who attacked you. | Succeded a [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) test. |

#### Berserking (End)
Whether as a well-honed skill and way of life, or through a disappointing childhood of misery and pain, berserking is a talent for fighting angrily and recklessly. It allows a fighter to keep fighting at surprising strength, even when wounded. 

However, the price for this strength is steep. The chance of death is greatly increased for anyone who embraces this way of fighting. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | **Ob**  | Effect(s)          | Condition(s) |
| ----- | -------------------- | -- | ------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| 1     | Reckless Assault     | 2  | /       | Deal an extra **D** of damage on your next successful attack during this turn, according to your weapon's damage. Suffer a **-2D** penalty on all defence tests until the start of your next turn. Cannot convert left-over AP into [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) or [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi).  |  |
| 2     | Grit Your Teeth      | 0  | /       | Ignore the negative effects of one [injury](#injury) of choice for the rest of the combat encounter. It will still count towards the injury limit, however! | Once per combat. |
| 3     | Pain is Strength     | 3  | Opposed | Perform a [single-target](#single-target-st) melee attack against an opponent of choice. For every active [injury](#injury) you currently have, deal one extra **D** of damage. You suffer one point of [exhaustion](#exhaustion). | Once per day. |

#### Fishing (End)
The ability to efficiently catch fish. 

#### Instrument-Playing < instrument > (Agi)
Playing an instrument of choice. 

The instrument in question must be noted. 

#### Melee Defence (Agi)
Skill at defending oneself in close-combat. If a test of this skill is successful, the attacker's attack is negated entirely (unless the attack in question states otherwise).

If you succeed an [active defense](#defending) using this **skill**, then for every **positive** that you achieve over the attacker, you can choose one of the following **stunts**:
* Disarm your opponent (if they have a detachable weapon). 
* Displace your opponent. They are forced to stumble backwards by 1m/3' in a direction of your choosing. 
* Throw your opponent to the ground, making them [proned](#prone). 
* Launch a counter-attack, for half your weapon's regular damage. You'll have to roll a regular attack, which your opponent can choose to defend against. 

#### Ranged Defence (Agi)
Skill at evading projectiles. If a test of this skill is successful, the attacker's attack is negated entirely (unless the attack in question states otherwise).

If you succeed an [active defense](#defending) using this **skill**, then for every **positive** that you achieve over the attacker, you can choose one of the following **stunts**:
* Displace yourself. You move 3'/1m in a direction of your choosing. 
* You catch the projectile (if such a feat could be "reasonably" done). 
* If the location of the shooter was unknown, you now have a good idea on where they are. 

#### Stealth (Agi)
Moving silently and performing actions undetected. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | **Ob**  | Effect(s)          | Condition(s) |

| 3     | Muffled Fumble       | 0  | 2       | When failing a **stealth test**, re-roll two of your **negatives**. If you now succeed, treat that as the outcome of your original roll. | Failed a **stealth test**;  Once per rest. |
| 4    | Pocket-Sand           | 3  | Opposed | If you succeed a **stealth test** against a single designated target's [observation](#observation-perc), you can disappear from their sight and run up to 2 **AP** worth of distance. | Once per rest. |

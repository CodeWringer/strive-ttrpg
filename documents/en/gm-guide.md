## The Role Of A Game Master
As the **GM**, you are the one person at the table playing a different game than the others. Instead of controlling a single character in a given world, you are in control of the world itself and determine what the characters within it get to do. 

You're the one who decides on the tone of the world. Is it grimdark? Or perhaps heroic, instead? You should be clear about this, before you even interview your first player. 

What adventure(s) will the players be engaging in? Murder mystery? Grand strategy? A heist? Perhaps nothing quite so specific. Perhaps you'll simply present them with a mix of adventures and see which one they pick. 

You're also the one who organizes everything. On what days are your play sessions going to be on? What time? What do you do, if someone can't make it? Do you play without them or do you have boardgames at the ready for such an occasion? 

Who will get to be at your table and play in your game? You'll have to decide on that, too. You may involve your players in the process of judging the fitness of potential candidates, but ultimately, the final say lies with you. 

How will you run the game? Will it be a single play session (= one-shot) or a perpetual game? Do you want the game to be on-site, at your house or perhaps online? Will you use a webcam and do you expect your players to show themselves via webcam? 

It is *your world* and *your game*. The other people at the table are *your players*. Find the right players for your world and your game and make your game and world right for your players. 

### Your World
While **Ambersteel** is best suited to a medieval-fantasy world, it doesn't dictate the type of world you have to employ. 

You are encouraged to craft your own world to play in. You decide what species (like humans) exist, what nations and cultures vow for supremacy and what fantastical landscapes exist. Is magic prevalent? What types of magic exist? You decide. This world, is yours. 

Your players can aid in crafting the world. Usually during play, rather than outside of it. If you allow them to change your world through their actions, it becomes a much more dynamic and almost life-like beast. 

#### Bring NPCs To Life
Non-player characters (**NPC**s) are all the people of your world, that aren't the player characters (**PC**s). **NPC**s are one of your most important tools to bring your world to life and make it interesting and engaging to your players. More often than not, the most interesting sessions involve heavy or mindful use of **NPC**s. See them as you do real people. There are no rules or mechanics dictating how they should behave. 

Much like the **PC**s, or in fact real people, **NPC**s lead their own lives, with their own ambitions, beliefs, instincts, strengths and weaknesses. Keeping track of all of the numbers that implies, can become quite the challenge. But you won't have to come up with all those numbers right away or track them all the time.

Whenever the **PC**s encounter someone new, all you really need, is a rough idea of *who* that **NPC** *is*. You don't have to know all their history right away, nor all of their strengths, weaknesses or even their agenda. Invent those as needed and just keep notes on that. 

And *who* an **NPC** is, depends on several factors, such as:
* their social status (e. g. a noble vs. a peasant)
* their cultural background
* their physique
* their occupation (e. g. a carpenter vs. a professional soldier)
* their financial status
* what you *think* their agenda *should be*

While putting on an accent and visibly acting out the quirks of an **NPC** certainly helps in bringing them to life, what's more important is how they interact with the **PC**s. Are they supportive of the **PC**s? Do they offer a warm meal whenever they see the **PC**s or do they bar their door and close the window curtains? Do they stand up defiantly or cower meekly, when they interact with the **PC**s?

More often than not, you'll have **NPC**s be the source of quests and adventures for the **PC**s. But you can also have some **NPC**s that work for the **PC**s. This, especially, gives players a greater sense of agency, in your world. It allows them to move pieces on the board, so to speak. 

You also get to use **NPC**s as a tool to feed players information (or false rumors) about the world they're in. Be careful how you approach this, though. Players have a tendency to assume everything the **GM** says is true. So when an **NPC** feeds them false information, they tend not to question it. Before you can effectively use false information as a tool, you'll have to establish that **NPC**s will not always speak the truth. Perhaps by introducing an **NPC** very early on, who will tell the most outrageous lies. Maybe even about the **PC**s. That would certainly make your players sceptical. But the specifics of this are entirely up to you and your specific game. 

#### Use The Senses
When you describe scenes, not just what one can see is of relevance. What are the **PC**s' other senses picking up? What about hearing? Smell? Do the mages sense the flow of magic? What's the temperature like? Is the air damp or dry? Is the ground trembling from a giant's heavy footfalls?

Try to pick only the most significant and most symbolic influences on the senses for your scene. There is little point in describing the gentle rustle of the wind in the leaves, whenever the **PC**s enter a forest. But if there is a strong stench of decay in the air, then that's probably noteworthy. 

More often than not, players would be on the look-out for anything out of the ordinary in a given scene. So anything obvious to the **PC**s, anything that *should* stand out to them, you should describe to them. And that includes smells, noises, temperature, humidity, etc. 

Of course, sometimes, describing a peaceful and soothing scene can be a welcome and effective change. After a harrowing fight, the **PC**s might enter a safe area, where you describe it as a peaceful meadow or serene village or anything along those lines. 

### Your Game
There is an *unspoken social contract* between you, the **GM** and your players. Everyone at the table agrees that you *get to call the shots*. You present every scenario and its challenges, you arbitrate and moderate. You narrate and you listen. 

It is not, however, your job to think of possible solutions to the challenges you invent. *That*, is the *players' job*. It is also not your job to come up with PC reactions, emotions, thoughts, etc. That is also the players' job. 

The rules are also in your hands. If you find one of the **Ambersteel** rules to not be to your liking or simply not work in your game, change it, so that it fits your game. This is called *house-ruling* - introducing unofficial rules that are only in effect at your table. In fact, you're hereby strongly encouraged to modify and add to the rules, as you see fit. Especially the list of skills or magic schools is non-exhaustive, meaning, there is a very high chance one of your players will want their character to do something, for which there isn't a skill defined, yet. You can even allow your players to invent skills and skill abilities. That way, not *all* of the work lies on you, but be mindful that you'll have to ensure the skills and abilities *make sense* and don't result in a character *suddenly* becoming an invulnerable power-house. 

Keep in mind that with the **authority** to *make decisions*, also comes a certain **responsibility**. It is your task, to entertain your players. Not like a comedian or a singer, but something more varied and complex than that. You agree to keep your players **interested and engaged** in your game. You agree to weave their characters into stories of which you may have no idea how they'll play out. 

And you agree to **mediate and moderate**. When players fight, in-person, then there may be a time when you, as the one running the game have to step in and find a resolution. Either you can find a way for them to reconcile, or someone may have to leave the game. When players keep talking over each other, it is your responsibility to moderate. Have them take turns when speaking. Make sure everyone who has something to say, gets to. 

Even if all of these and the following points may sound very dogmatic, see them more as well-intentioned advice, than hard rules for you to follow. Find your style and develop it as you like. 

Of course, the specifics of the *unspoken social contract* can be different for you and your group. But perhaps the social contract doesn't *have* to remain unspoken. It might be a good idea to ensure everyone is on the same page, in regards to what is expected of **GM** and players.

#### To Rule or Not To Rule
The rules serve to facilitate the resolution of uncertain outcomes, to add tension and drama and introduce challenges for the players to deal with. 

Obviously, as the **GM**, you have to know the rules well, in order to keep the game paced well. Keep in mind, however, that the rules can also get in the way of *your game's* pacing. 

Rules discussions and looking up rules is best kept for later. Keep the game flowing or else risk losing the interest of your players! That means making a ruling now, based on what you *think* might be the right call in the given situation. Then, later, when the players are busy, or when you're taking a break, you can look up what the right rule might have been. 

When a player tries to argue a ruling, they're violating the unspoken social contract. Tell them it's time to move on and address their questions and concerns after the session. 

### Your Players
The game can only happen, because of your players - the people willing to be at your table and engage with your game. Treat them with the same respect you expect from them. 

You're primarily running this game for your players - without them, you might as well write a book, instead. Therefore it should be your top priority to keep them entertained and focused on the game, or else you risk losing them. 

Understand how your players think and how they enjoy their table-top role-playing game experience. If they like combat and loathe interacting with **NPC**s, you can cater to that and present them with lots of *interesting* combat scenarios. On the other hand, if they love to role-play, they'll probably enjoy meeting and interacting with **NPC**s. 

Figuring out how to get your players engaged in your game and noticing that engagement, can be a very rewarding sensation. It is a sign of a fun and worth-while experience. 

But not just the conflicts within game itself require your attention. When two players fight, you'll have to step in, if they can't resolve the matter themselves. Try to mediate, when possible. And have the wisdom to tell when reconciliation is impossible. As difficult as it may be, sometimes you'll have to let a player go, if they don't fit into the group. 

Besides the mediator, you're also the moderator. Make sure your players are respectful towards each other, as well, by stopping players talking over each other. 

This, and all the tips in the *your game* section serve as tools to keep the game paced well and filled with interesting and engaging content. A well-paced game is one that keeps the players' interest. 

## How To Master Your Game
While the previous section gives a broad overview of the expectations of a **GM**, this sections aims to help you fulfill those expectations. 

### Starting Your Session
#### Recap The Last Session
A good start for every session is asking one of your players (volunteers first) to outline what their characters did and experienced in the last session. This refreshes everyone's memory on what they did and should be doing. It also encourages them to take notes during play. 

It is important you only correct them on crucial plot points, which they really should get right. Keep in mind that players tend to see the **GM**'s word as **absolute truth**. This is why, when you re-tell the events and those differ from what the players remember, it might alienate them from the world and the story. They thought they understood what was going on, but then you correct them and prove they were wrong all along - that is frustrating and harmful. 

In fact, you may even correct some of the details of how events *actually* played out, based on what your players re-tell. Do so silently, though. The last thing you want, is to encourage *meta-gaming*, where your players intentionally recap the last session incorrectly, in a way to make you change details in their characters' favor. 

#### Read Out Ambitions, Beliefs & Instincts
Once the last session has been refreshed, move on to have every player, one by one, read out aloud to all, their character's ambition (keep this one brief), current **beliefs** and current **instincts**. 

There are two reasons to do this:
1. The other players can know, if a belief targets their character. So if a **PC** (player) starts acting odd towards another player (their **PC**), that player knows it's part of the role-play and not directed towards them as a person. <br>
It also allows the player whose character is targeted by the belief to form ideas on how to react to it. 
2. It lets you know the **ambitions**, **beliefs** and **instincts** of your **PC**s. And you have to know those, to be able to *challenge* them. <br> 
You certainly don't *have to* make your players read their **beliefs** out aloud, to know them, but this keeps the busiwork on your part down. And you have enough work to do, as it is. 

Be mindful that players knowing the **beliefs** of their fellow **PC**s should not be allowed to meta-game. 

> If a **PC** has a belief to the detriment of their fellow **PC** and this is a fresh belief, the targeted **PC** shouldn't suddenly become more suspicious towards their ally. At least not without sufficient reason. Of course, a **PC** can figure out another's intentions, but not by virtue of their owning player knowing. 

#### Read Out Fate Point Purchases
Once **ambitions**, **beliefs** and **instincts** are handled, move on to what meta-powers players purchased with their [fate points](#fate-points). 

Everyone should be clear on what everyone else can do, especially since these are strictly meta-game powers. 

### Your Session
While running the session, you'll have the most work and the toughest job. Listen to your players attentively, react and improvise as needed. 

You'll have to keep a lot of rules in mind. This section aims to provide a set of reminders. 

#### Choosing **Ob**
Choosing the right **Ob** for a test is a difficult task, for which clear rules cannot be easily written. More times than not, your gut-feeling will have to tell you which number is *right* for the given test. 

* T - Trivial
* E - Easy
* D - Difficult
* C - Challenging
* Blanks are impossible

The following table provides a decent point of orientation for **attribute** tests: 
Level | **Ob** 1 | **Ob** 2 | **Ob** 3 | **Ob** 4 | **Ob** 5 | **Ob** 6 | **Ob** 7 | **Ob** 8 | **Ob** 9 | **Ob** 10
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1  | C |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
| 2  | C | C |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
| 3  | D | C | C |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
| 4  | E | D | C | C |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
| 5  | E | D | D | C | C |   |   |   |   |   | 
| 6  | T | E | D | D | C | C |   |   |   |   | 
| 7  | T | T | E | E | D | C | C |   |   |   | 
| 8  | T | T | T | E | E | D | C | C |   |   | 
| 9  | T | T | T | E | E | D | C | C | C |   | 
| 10 | T | T | T | E | E | D | D | C | C | C | 

The following table provides a decent point of orientation for **skill** tests: 
Level | **Ob** 1 | **Ob** 2 | **Ob** 3 | **Ob** 4 | **Ob** 5 | **Ob** 6 | **Ob** 7 | **Ob** 8 | **Ob** 9 | **Ob** 10
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1  | D | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | 
| 2  | D | D | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | 
| 3  | D | D | D | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | 
| 4  | E | D | D | D | C | C | C | C | C | C | 
| 5  | E | E | D | D | D | C | C | C | C | C | 
| 6  | T | E | E | D | D | D | C | C | C | C | 
| 7  | T | T | E | E | D | D | D | C | C | C | 
| 8  | T | T | T | E | E | D | D | D | C | C | 
| 9  | T | T | T | E | E | D | D | D | D | C | 
| 10 | T | T | T | T | E | E | D | D | D | D | 

When to test either an **attribute**, or a **skill**, also requires a certain gut-feeling. **Attribute**s are typically the raw, innate abilities of a character. 
**Skills** on the other hand are learned abilities. 

#### Challenging Your Players
You have two means of challenging your players: *mechanical challenges* and *narrative challenges*. To *challenge* your players means to *engage* them! 

**Mechanical challenges** are your *game-y* tools to engage your players. You engage them, by challenging their characters. You put tests or limitations before them, which have to be overcome mechanically. Dice are usually involved. 

You should be intimately familiar with the [tests](#tests) section. When to use what type of test can not be cast in a sure-fire ruleset, and rather requires you to develop a sense for it. **Creative tests** allow your players the most freedom and should thus be the most interesting way for them to resolve a mechanical challenge. But over-use this type of test and your players might start feeling irritated and mentally exhausted too quickly. 

[Injuries](#injury) and [illnesses](#illness) involve mechanical hurdles for the **PC**s to overcome. The solution is presented in the rules. If you're injured or ill, seek medical aid and spend time resting. While some of the player party may be incapacitated, the other half can roll some dice to have their character [practice their skills](#practice) or [practice their attributes](#practicing-attributes). Of course, this results in not very interesting mechanical challenges, because they leave little room for interpretation. 

**Narrative challenges** are your *role-playing* tools to engage your players. The engagement and challenge comes from making your players think about what their character's belief and how they act. 

You challenge a player narratively, by putting their characters in situations where they'll have to think like their character. Challenge their beliefs, challenge their morals. 

And the most powerful narrative challenge - the world! Encourage your players to set goals. Goals, which will impact the world around their characters. But also provide a world which will react to the player characters' actions, even when no goal has been explicitly stated. 

> Exterminating the entire population of a given village is bound to leave evidence. Rumors start to spread, and hostilities may flare up. Law men may be sent to investigate. Populations of other villages become nervous and suspicious of strangers. 
> 
> The world reacts to this heinous act, even if the players may never stated their intent for it. 

##### **Challenge your PCs' abilities during combat**
More interesting scenarios come from challenging your **PC**s' abilities. Present the close-quarters warrior with an opponent who's out of reach. Have the blood-letting fanatic deal with a foe that can't bleed. Present the mage with an opponent clad in [Amberite](#amberite). But always keep in mind one thing - the foes your players engage should have weaknesses and they should not be unbeatable, unless you make it **very** clear to the players their characters couldn't win a straight fight. 

Also try to occasionally have foes that target the **PC** they counter, but also make sure one of the other **PC**s can counter them, in turn. 

> The player party's mage is ambushed by an [Amberite](#amberite)-clad fanatic. The mage shoots fire at their assailant, but finds the fire dissipate into nothing more than hot smoke right before the fanatic's eyes. But the mage's ally, a halberd-wielding ex-footsoldier jumps in and lands a devastating blow, severly injuring the fanatic. 
> 
> The wounded fanatic cannot fight on and attempts to flee. The **PC**s can now attempt to attack the fleeing fanatic with conventional means, or let them go. The mage alone might not have had such an easy time of it. But thanks to their ally, they didn't have to fear that foe. 

Even more interesting fights can occur, if you involve the environment, as well. Introduce both hazards and tools for the **PC**s to be threatened by, or to exploit. These are just some examples of interactive combat environments: 
* An illegal gunpowder storage. Any careless use of fire could cause a cascade of explosions. Be mindful to not straight-up wipe out the **PC**s if the gunpowder does get set on fire. They should be harmed, but give them a chance to recover or flee from that blunder. 
* A giant cave, full of giant spider webs. If anyone should be unfortunate enough to stumble or be knocked into a web, a giant spider descends from the shadowy corners of the ceiling and begins to threaten that character, specifically. If that happens to be a **PC**, their allies have to think quick, to get them free, but also keep their original opponents on their toes. On the other hand, the **PC**s can attempt to knock their foes into the webs. 
* A burning house, with the **PC**s and their opponents in the thick of it. At the start of every turn, a burning piece of debris falls from the ceiling and you randomly determine where it lands. Could be on a **PC**, could be on one of their opponents. Or it could be in front of and barring their only exit - an open window leading to safety. 
* A rickety, old bridge, which could collapse if too much force was applied to its support beams. The **PC**s could exploit this to collapse the bridge on purpose. Or their opponents could attempt the same, to put time-pressure on the players. 

##### **Challenge your PCs' abilities out of combat**
Outside of combat, you can challenge your **PC**s' skills. Present opportunities for the **PC**s to [learn new things](#advancing-skills). Present them with tests for skills they don't have. But do so sparingly. It is frustrated for a player to never get to play to their character's strengths. Give players that satisfaction of having *the right skill at the right time*. 

When it comes to skill tests, it is prudent to be wary of *test band-wagon'ing*. When you ask a specific player (or rather, their character) to do a test in a certain skill or attribute and if they fail, another player jumps in and asks, if they can try, consider well how you answer. 

If you allow it, you make the player you first asked feel less special and important. After all, you must have had a good reason why *only their character* could do the test, to begin with. If you found that only that one **PC** had a chance at even attempting the test, you shouldn't allow other **PC**s to make the test. 

> A classic example is asking one of your players to test their character's [perception](#perception-perc). They fail and the other players immediately ask if they can try, as well. If they could, you shouldn't have asked just the one player, but instead asked all of them to begin with. 
> 
> But if you think only their character could have succeeded that test, you shouldn't allow the others to try. 

On the other hand, you should only have such specifically targeted tests, if failure doesn't result in a dead-end for the **PC**s. Try to aim more towards tests that can result in the players being informed of a potential challenge ahead of time. 

> For example, a sneaky **PC** might have successfully infiltrated a palace, where they aim to gather intelligence on their political enemies. The **GM** asks them to do a [perception](#perception-perc) test, which they succeed. As a result, the **GM** informs the player, that their character overhears voices from a room next door. 
> 
> The **PC** walks up to the door leading to the other room, and eavedrops. They overhear two men talking about increased patrols and sightings of an intruder. The player decides, based on that information, to leave the palace early, as things are getting too risky for them to stay. 
> 
> Had the **PC** failed their test, the **GM** would have told them to move on. Perhaps even given them a different piece of information, like hearing noises outside the room they're in, but without a clear direction. The player might not think much of it, and decide to stay. That's when the guards walk in and surprise the **PC**. They can still make their get-away, albeit involving more running in blind panic, than sneaking calmly. 

##### **Fewer Tests Are Better**
Only have a player make one test per scene/situation, as long as the scene/situation doesn't change significantly. 

> For example, a **PC** is trying to sneak past two guards huddled around a campfire. If they succeed their [stealth](#stealth-agi) test, the **GM** lets them sneak all around the camp, without making them do multiple tests, as long as the situation doesn't change significantly. One of the guards getting up to take a pee behind a tree somewhere shouldn't be such a change, even if that happens to be the tree the **PC** is hiding behind. On the other hand, if the guards pick up torches and start actively looking for intruders, for whatever reason, then the situation changes significantly. Another [stealth](#stealth-agi) test would be warranted. 

> A **PC** succeeds an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test to climb a wall. Thus, it is established that the **PC** *can* climb that wall. Whenever they attempt to climb that wall in the future, they simply succeed, with no test needed. Unless, of course, if the wall got taller since the last attempt. 

Of course, how many tests are appropriate in a given situation is entirely at your discretion. 

##### **Limit Resources**
Also keep in mind that the [item slots](#carrying-capacity) system exists to create mechanical challenges. Limit the **PC**'s access to the resources they tend to hoard. 

Although your players could also be clever and find narrative solutions to their lack of *item vaccuuming*. If they can afford one or two carriages with the horses and drivers, perhaps even guards, they should be allowed to transport a lot more stuff around. Within the confines of their solution, of course. Those wagons full of ammunition, medical supplies and spare daggers will have to stay outside the cave/dungeon/ruin/etc. - unless your players can find a solution for that, too. 

Possessions in the form of coin and steel are not the only type of resource you can give your **PC**s. Keep in mind that servants, hirelings, close friends and family are *also a resource*. **PC**s can refer to them, when they have need of information, coin or political support. 

##### **Challenge Your PCs' Beliefs**
And that brings us to narrative challenges. These are the challenges you present your players, moreso than their characters. 

Still bordering on *game-y*, the [ambitions, beliefs and instincts](#ambitions-beliefs--instincts) and [fate points](#fate-points) systems reward players for role-playing well and for playing to their character's beliefs. 

Make sure to regularly challenge **each** **PC**'s **beliefs** and **instincts**. You do so, by confronting them with a situation in which, if they act in accordance with their belief, it gets them or their allies *in trouble*. 

This keeps the players on their toes and puts pressure on them when they have to make a difficult call. Will they play to their character's belief - and get them in trouble - or do they refuse and thus violate the belief? This is also where a large part of the *easy role-playing* comes from, because it is mechanically supported. 

More interesting and less immediately rewarding, is the **ambition** of a **PC**. These long-term goals guide their character along the way. Make sure to throw them a small plot to advance their own agenda, every once in a while. 

> For example, a **PC** has an old enemy who they've vowed to take revenge on. While the final confrontation is still a ways away, every once in a while, that **PC** finds information regarding their enemy. You could feed that player information on their **PC**'s enemy's current or recent whereabouts and activities. Not enough to give them a trail to follow, but enough to keep them aware of their long-term goal. 
> 
> Then, you present them with an opportunity to steal some resource from their enemy. Be it a valuable item, person or political power - something is within reach. This will likely be its own small adventure for the player party to engage with - if they so choose. 
> 
> Eventually, some henchmen of the **PC**'s enemy make an appearance. They aim to challenge the player party. This is important - not just the one **PC** is involved, but **all of them**. This makes the **PC**'s *personal concern*, a *party concern*. 
> 
> And so it goes on, with continually more escalating scenarios, which all culminate into the final confrontation, many real-world sessions into the future, when the **PC** gets to put the final nail in that **ambition**'s coffin - and earn their [AFP](#ambition-fate-points).

##### **Anchor Your PCs Down**
Another resource, is a base of operations. This is a very meaningful and powerful tool, to anchor your **PC**s to a particular domain. Expect them to want to return to their base of operations regularly. While this *may* narrow the radius of exploration your players are willingly to go, it doesn't necessarily have to. What it is guaranteed to do, however, is make your players care about *that space* in the world, in particular. 

Be mindful *where* in the world you give them such a resource, because that is where the players will want to spend a lot of time at. Make sure it is a location where quests can easily come to them. Damsels in distress, kings in need and wealthy merchants all need a reachable door to knock at. A very remote location might not see a lot of *action* or *visitors*. 

##### **Threaten Your PCs**
Any resource you let a **PC** have, can be *threatened*. This is a powerful tool to raise tension among your players. Threaten their possessions, family or holdings - all the things they hold dear. 

This is a powerful tool to make the players care about protecting their assets. If you have given them a small castle in a sparsely populated area, make sure to have someone threaten to take away that castle at least (or at most) **once**. By the time that happens, the players should have grown accustomed to having that safe space to return and haul loot to. Suddenly, their top-priority will be protecting that place. 

Once they've fended off the attackers, they'll really start caring about everything that's happening on or near their home turf. This is when wars and rumors become of much greater relevance to your players, as they don't want their assets (which they before took for granted) threatened *again*. 

In order to avoid frustrating your players, you shouldn't threaten their more valuable resources often. Used sparingly, this tool can cause great tension and players scrambling to find a creative solution. But used too frequently, your players might start getting frustrated, because you harm their sense of progression. If they never truly gain anything, why *should* they care if it is threatened? 

##### **Allow World-Change**
Have your players change your world. No matter what they do, the **PC**s' actions are going to leave ripples running through the world. 

If they ruthlessly slaughter a tribe of non-humans, they might inadvertently cause an increased radicalization among the other tribes of those same non-humans. Likewise, if the **PC**s go around protecting villages against raids, those villages might prosper and the villagers might offer gifts (like a warm meal and bed) to the **PC**s. 

On the other hand, if the players are actively trying to change a major aspect of the world, like the political structure in a neighboring country, allow it - but make it difficult. The players will have to work a bit to achieve that goal. Not just in terms of time invested, but in terms of creative preparation. 

This is the most powerful way to narratively challenge players. It helps them see your fictional world as *real* and they start thinking about the consequences of their actions more often. This encourages peaceful and creative solutions, where before they might have preferred blunt violence. 

#### Keep Them Engaged
There is nothing worse than getting your players to "clock out" and stop paying attention to your game! This means they're not having fun and may even start wondering why they're even spending time at your table. If that keeps up, they'll inevitably leave. 

To avoid such a fate for your game, you must keep your players *hooked*! Keep them thinking that at any moment, they might get a chance to jump in and contribute just the right question, defuse a conflict or otherwise play out their character's strengths. 

##### Keep That Spotlight On a Swivel
It is only natural that some of your players may speak up before others. Whether they've simply got a dominant voice or immediately start talking, by doing so they'll probably discourage the others from speaking. 

Once you've identified which of your players tend to remain quiet, make sure **you give them the spotlight** every once in a while. 

Make sure to get a sense of who will **grab the spotlight** and who won't. Sometimes, you may even have to stop someone from grabbing it and instead allow one of the quieter players to act **first**. If the quieter player relinquishes the spotlight, let them. Don't force anyone into a situation they're uncomfortable with! That would only, if repeated too often, result in them leaving your game. 

Whenever you present your players with a new situation, especially with moments intended to *surprise* them, make sure to ask their characters' reactions! Go through each of your players and ask them, "how does your character react to this?" This allows each of them to play out their character and to breathe *life* into them. 

Also, when a decision must be made, like where the party will go and what they'll do next, make sure to ask **every** player. Nothing is worse than a player character being dragged along, even though their player isn't the least bit interested in the plot hook the others want to follow. By asking everyone, you may expose that some of them may have different plans. The goal then is to find a **compromise**! Do not let the one side of players force their will upon the others! Instead, encourage your players to find a way to motivate each other to follow the plot hook. Encourage them to find some reason or to be persuaded to go along. This way, no player feels left out, during decision-making. 

Some players may not really be interested in talking too much. But if they're simply uncomfortable with improvisation, see the following section [Fair Warning](#fair-warning). 

If you have any of those, you can still keep them engaged, by providing them other opportunities to shine. A skill test that only their character can even attempt, for example. 

##### Player Agency
A very important thing to remember is that **all decisions** are made **by your players**, not *you*. This is understood as "player-agency" - a player's ability to make a meaningful decision, which impacts your world and the story plot, even when in collision with your own expectations or plans. 

And that implies that asking your players, whenever there is a choice to be made, what their decision will be. After all, you're not writing a book, where you can and even have to decide on what the protagonists will do. Your players will have to tell you what they'll do. 

While it is certainly *work* to keep track of what everyone wants to do, the benefits of that work are significant. Your players are engaged, because they have agency in your world. This is where the beauty of role-playing games shines through. You're telling a story together, where the outcome is uncertain and surprises may happen at any time. 

Of course, there is an exception to every rule. You *can* take player-agency away, but there are conditions for doing so. Firstly, you must make it **absolutely clear** to your players, that for the given situation, you'll dictate what happens. Secondly, you must have sound reason for dictating what happens. Whatever that reason is, it should be a rare instance, something that only happens on special occasions. 

For example, there may be times, when for storytelling purposes you may want to narrate something. Perhaps an event far away from the player characters. The term "cut-scene" is applicable. It's a moment when you take over as the narrator and narrate something that happens, that the players couldn't possibly have agency over. Whenever doing so is appropriate, depends strongly on the story and your style of game. If done well, this can serve as a tool for world-building (investing your players in your world) and/or tension-building (drama!)

##### Rewards!
Nothing motivates players (and humans in general) more, than the promise of reward!

The important thing to keep in mind here, is to **reward behaviors** you wish to **encourage**. 

If you want your players to be curious about and engage with your world, then reward them for it! If you want your players to kill monsters and defeat bad guys, reward them for it! 

Exactly how you present the promise of reward is up to you. Whether you hand out cards, in the format of goal - reward, or simply have NPCs that tell your player characters about rewards, will depend on what works best for you and your players. 

Another important note is to avoid overloading your players with promises of reward. That could lead to analysis paralysis - the inability to prioritise goals and then committing to one. This problem is exacerbated by timed rewards - rewards that will expire after a certain amount of time. If too many of those timed rewards exist, your players will find it very difficult to pick one, for fear of losing out on the other ones. 

##### Fair Warning
Another tool in your bag, is the ability to give a player *fair warning* of something that will come up during the next session. 

This means telling a player well ahead of time that during the next session a situation may crop up in which they'll have to react. 

This is especially effective at allowing those players who're uncomfortable with improvisation to prepare themselves ahead of time. This helps them alleviate the feeling of nervousness and they may even surprise you with the answer they've cooked up! 

When giving such a *heads-up*, try to omit any details. Only give your player a basic prompt to work with. However, just how much information the prompt should contain, will be up to you. 

> For example, a NPC will do something that contradicts their character's beliefs. A prompt for that player could look like the following: "During the next session, an NPC will do something that contradicts your beliefs. There will be no way you wouldn't notice." Don't tell them which NPC that will be or what exactly that NPC will actually do. 

### Ending Your Session
#### Hand Out Fate Points
You end every session by nominating players for [fate points](#fate-points) they earned during play. Players should also nominate and vote for each other. Whether someone gets their **FP** is based on majority vote. 

If you're short on time and have to end the session without voting for [fate points](#fate-points), make sure to do so at the start of the next session!

#### Gather Feedback
While entirely up to you, it is always a good idea to gather feedback from your players. 

You could ask them the following:
* What was your favorite moment of today's session?
* What was your least favorite moment of today's session?
* Was the balance of combat vs. role-play to your liking?
* (If there was NPC-interaction) What was your favorite **NPC** interaction today?
  * Take note - that is an NPC you can *threaten* later, and have that player *care*.

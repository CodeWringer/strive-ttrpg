# Fantasy Game-Masters Resource
This and the following sections are reserved solely for the **GM**'s eyes. Reading on as a player may spoil many surprises and the fun of discovery for you. 

## Creature Compendium
A by no means exhaustive list of medieval-fantasy themed creatures for the **GM** to draw from. 

### Veil Entities
Veil Entities are unlike any other. They are strange and unfathomable things from a dimension, or other form of existence unlike any we know. These entities aren't necessarily evil, nor are they particularly interested in causing harm, if indeed they are capable of sentience at all. It is their very nature that is harmful to ours. Fortunately, The Veil reclaims its denizens diligently. 

#### The Monolith
A rough-hewn, crystalline monolith of obsidian color. Crimson veins pulsate gently, just beneath the surface. It draws every gaze towards it, whispering unknowable secrets and beckoning with malignity. Everyone within a `30'/10m` radius around it is affected and suffers `+1` [Bleeding](strive-core.md#bleeding) at the start of their turn and **cannot** look away, for as long as they have line of sight to it. The Monolith lasts for `5` rounds or `5` minutes, before The Veil reclaims it. When that happens, it explodes, dealing `1D10` [bludgeoning](strive-core.md#damage-types) damage and inflicting `+3` [Bleeding](strive-core.md#bleeding) to all within its radius.

#### Perfection
A giant sphere of pure white light. Its surface is infinitely smooth. Nothing can stick to it, nothing can touch it. Everything that touches it, is thrown back, by `24'/8m`. And yet, every living thing in a `90'/30m` radius around it desires nothing more than to touch it, unless they succeed a Self-Control test at Ob `5` at the start of their turn. The Sphere lasts for `5` rounds or `5` minutes, before it vanishes, leaving behind darkness and emptiness that fills all hearts with unconsolable sorrow. Every creature in range is [Pacified](strive-core.md#pacified) for `1` round or minute.

#### The Tar Mycelium
The entire scene is covered in a black, slimy web of tiny pulsating strands of a massive mycelium. This fungus grows quickly, rapidly enveloping everything it touches. All movement is slowed by `3'/1m` per **AP** spent. If a creature stands still for `2` turns, the fungus envelops them and begins devouring them alive. They suffer `2D4` [Acid](strive-core.md#damage-types) damage at the end of their second turn and after that, at the start of every turn they haven't yet moved.

#### Cacophony of Flesh
An abominable mound of misshapen flesh, with countless tiny and several massive ragged tentacles protruding from it. As soon as it is able, it will violently thrash about, trying *desperately* to inflict vengeful violence upon all in its path. 

| Attributes | Level |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Agi        | 5     |
| Awar       | 5     |
| Str        | 20    |
| Tough      | 20    |
| Wit        | 1     |

#### The Puppeteer
A giant stick-figure, shrouded in swirling darkness and blurred edges. All corpses, no matter how old, within `900'300m` around the Puppeteer begin to move again. They arise from their tombs, graves and battlefields, to enact terrible vengeance on the living. The Puppeteer lasts for several days. Should The Puppeteer be called again from The Veil in the time it is already present, then several more days will be added to the time it may escape The Veil.

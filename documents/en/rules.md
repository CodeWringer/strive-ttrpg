Version 0.9

A role-playing game by Nicolas Haase

# Introduction
**Ambersteel** is a table-top role-playing game (**TTRPG**), requiring a **game master** (**GM**) and at least one **player** to play. 

On the spectrum of *narrative-driven*, *game-y* and *simulationist*, **Ambersteel** aims for the region between *game-y* and *narrative-driven*, while leaning heavily towards *game-y*:
* Combat is a risky affair and requires tactical and strategic thinking, or the readiness to retreat, when things go awry. When a character suffers **injuries**, they are in *serious trouble*. 
* Magic is a risky affair, with a chance for a spell to fail and back-fire. The chance of failure is manageable, however. 
* Players are expected to manage resources, such as their character's health and possessions. Character's are neither *damage sponges*, nor *item vacuums*. 
* **PC** change and roleplaying are embedded into the rules. There are no classes or other arbitrary restrictions on what a character can do. **Attributes** and **skills** improve as they are used, incentivising experimentation. Characters have long-term and short-term goals and beliefs, which drive them onward and which change over time. 
* Characters can help each other in game mechanical ways, encouraging co-operative play. 
* Generalist characters benefit from their varied knowledge, while specialists enjoy unique abilities. 
* **PC**s aren't expected to start powerful and skilled. But they're expected to become powerful and skilled over the course of a long campaign. 

While each player only controls a single character, the **GM** is in control of every single non-player character (**NPC**), the world and the story. A player character is abbreviated as **PC**. 

The system is designed to fit a low to medium fantasy medieval setting. 

The rules are designed to be as intuitive and simple as possible, while complex enough to allow players to make meaningful choices. 

Most rules will have a certain degree of vagueness to them. This is at least partially deliberate. The situations that can come up during play are simply too varied and numerous to be possible to completely cover with rules, without requiring epic tomes filled to the brim with highly specific rulings for highly specific situations. Instead, the game relies on the **GM** to arbitrate in every situation. The descriptions in the rules here should serve as a point of orientation for the **GM**. How they interpret the rules, is how they're to be understood. 

Despite the focus on tactical and deadly combat, this is not an *adversarial* game. The **GM** and the players work ***together*** to create a unique experience and weave a story of glorious triumph, tragic defeat or anything in-between. Ultimately, the **GM**'s job is to provide interesting conundrums to the players and their job is to provide interesting answers, in-line with what their characters believe. What's important to remember is that the **GM** is a *player*, too. They're here to have fun and enjoy their time at the table, too. That is why it's important to work ***together***. 

# Credits
**Ambersteel** is not a revolution of the RPG genre and it was never meant to be. It is an amalgam and consolidation of rules I found to my liking, topped off with minor inventions of my own, in hopes of crafting a deep, yet intuitive system. 

As such, I took inspiration from other systems I have read, played and enjoyed in the past:
* **The Burning Wheel**, by Luke Crane and Dan Abram
* **Zweihänder**, by Daniel D. Fox
* **Knave**, by Ben Milton

# How to Play
As **Ambersteel** is a **roleplaying game**, there are certain rules and expectations of both players and **GM**. 

In some places, where distances are concerned, both feet and meters are noted as units. What attentive readers will notice, is that the conversion between the numbers won't always be correct. This is a deliberate decision to make the math easier, whenever a grid (or *battlemap*) is used in play. One square on the grid should represent either a three foot, or one meter square. Furthermore, a single, ordinary human, should occupy an entire such square. 

### Dice
**Ambersteel** uses a **dice pool** system of **six-sided dice** (henceforth referred to as **D6**) to resolve [tests](#tests). *Dice pool* means a variable number of dice will be rolled, based on a character's [attributes](#attributes), [skills](#skills), boons and circumstance of the situation they're in. 

The following types of dice come into play:
* **D3** - three-sided dice
* **D4** - four-sided dice
* **D6** - six-sided dice
* **D10** (**D100**) - two ten-sided dice

### Before the Game
Before anyone can start to play, the players have to [create their characters](#character-creation). Ideally, this process should be done in cooperation with the **GM** and each other, to make sure the character concepts fit into the world and planned narrative. Also, it is advisable to design characters that will work well together, as a group. 

### The Session
This is the time, when the magic happens. The players and **GM** have come together and begin or continue the story. 

[Fate points](#fate-points) cannot be awarded during play and neither can cards be bought from the [hand of fate](#hand-of-fate). However, players and the **GM** should take note of every situation they believe a **PC** (their own included) could have earned a [fate point](#fate-points).

### After the Session
After a playing session is done, the players and **GM** should stick around to discuss which players earned [fate points](#fate-points). This is where players are nominated for [fate points](#fate-points), by each other and by the **GM**. If everyone agrees, the [fate points](#fate-points) are awarded. Players can and should lobby for their [fate points](#fate-points), but shouldn't beg. If most everyone else says no, then that decision stands. That doesn't mean there is no point in discussing the matter further, but such a discussion shoulnd't be forced. 

Also after the session, players and the **GM** discuss whether a **PC** should lose an [instinct](#instincts), because they have acted against it or haven't gotten to play it out at all. 

Any time in between sessions, players can spend [fate points](#fate-points) to buy cards (boons) from the [hand of fate](#hand-of-fate).

Also any time in between sessions, players should re-evaluate their character's [beliefs](#beliefs) and change them, as they see fit. 

## Tests
Whenever the outcome of an action or situation is uncertain, a **test** may be called for by the **GM**, in order to resolve it. 

As a basis for a test, either an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) is used. 

Either a **six** or a **five** rolled on a single die counts as a **positive**. Other values are considered **negatives**. **Positives** are required in order to succeed a test. 

How many **positives** are needed to succeed a test, is determined by the **GM**, via a mechanism called **obstacle** (henceforth referred to as **Ob**). The test can only succeed, if at least as many **positives** are rolled, as the **Ob** named by the **GM**. 

> For example, to succeed a test at **Ob 3**, at least three **positives** must be rolled to succeed the test. Any less, and the test outcome is a failure. 

To resolve an **attribute test**, the number of **D6** indicated by the *attribute level* (the number next to the attribute) must be rolled. 

To resolve a **skill test**, the number of **D6** indicated by the **skill level** (the number next to the skill), plus half of the related **attribute** (rounded up) as additional dice must be rolled. 

> A **PC** has an [agility](#agility-agi) of 3 and an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) skill at level 2. The player is asked to roll a test for [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) at **Ob** 2. They get to roll 2 + 2 = 4 **D6**, if they don't have any other skills to [fork](#skill-forking) into the test. 

A [skill being learned](#learning-skills) is tested with *only* half of the related **attribute** (rounded up). 

For every test, one of three outcomes is possible: 
* **Complete Success**: There are enough or even more than required **positives**.
* **Partial Success/failure**: There are not enough **positives**, but more than none. 
* **Complete Failure**: There are no **positives**, only **negatives**. 

### Types of Test
There are the following types of tests. The **GM** decides when each type of test is appropriate. 

#### Binary Test
The outcome of the test is either a **complete success** or **complete failure**. A **partial success** is treated as if it were a **complete failure**. 

#### Stepped Test
A stepped test is really just a series of [binary tests](#binary-test). This allows for finer-grained results, while still not behaving like a [graduated test](#graduated-test). 

This type of test is useful for situations where the **GM** decides to create very fine *time slices* and allow more chances for success. This makes it easier to allow a **PC** to *fail forward* or prevent a *one roll to end it all* situation. 

> For example, a **PC** is attempting to cross a suspension bridge, but upon setting foot on the bridge, the ropes holding it up, suddenly snap. The **PC** can make an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test, to try and quickly jump off and back onto solid ground. They fail, and get to make another [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test at greater **Ob**, to try and grab a root sticking out of the ground beneath the bridge. They fail again! As a last chance for that **PC** to survive, the **GM** asks one of the other players if their character will attempt an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test at high **Ob**, to try and grab their falling ally's hand in a daring rescue. Finally, their ally succeeds and the **PC**'s life is saved. 
> 
> Obviously, such a situation should not arise often, as stepped tests can quickly grow exasperating. 

#### Graduated Test
The outcome of the test is graduated. That means, the number of **positives** rolled during the test factor into the outcome. This is called the **degree of success**. 

> For example, when crafting a work of art, the number of **positives** achieved may result in a more impressive piece, which can then be sold at a higher price or which could make for a more impressive gift. 

On the other hand, failure doesn't have to be absolute. The degree of failure can allow for a "failing forward" - a success, but with complications, whose severity depends on the number of failures. 

#### Creative Test
Also known as a **skill challenge**, this type of test asks the player(s) to pick and justify the skill(s) or attribute to use in a given situation. Players are encouraged to think creatively, come up with and describe their solutions. 

Whether the attribute or skill(s) in question can apply to resolve the situation at hand, lies at the **GM**'s discretion. 

#### Opposed Test
Also known as a *versus test*, this type of test occurs, when two characters come into opposition. Who wins, and by how much, is determined by comparing the number of **positives** of each character. The one with the most **positives** is the winner. 

If there is a tie, the **defending** character is considered the winner. 

What this means, is that the defender first rolls a test of their respective skill, against **Ob 0** (this 'automatic success' does **not** count towards skill progression) and the number of **positives** that result, plus one, is the resulting **Ob** for the attacker to match or exceed. 

> In combat, a defender rolls their [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) and achieves 3 positives. Thus, the attacker must achieve at least 4 **positives**, in order to win the opposed test. 

Whoever actually wins the opposed test, gets to note a success on their respective skill, while the loser must note a failure on their respective skill. 

> In combat, a defender rolls **melee defence** and achieves 3 positives.
> 
> The attacker rolls an attack and achieves 3 **positives**. The **positives** being tied with the defenders', means the defender wins, by default. 
> 
> Thus, the defender notes a success on their **melee defence**, while the attacker must note a failure on their respective attack skill. 

The terms of **attacker** and **defender** refer to the character initiating and the character reacting to the **opposed test**, respectively. 

> For example, a character tries to sneak past another, the sneaking character will have to succeed a [stealth](#stealth-agi) test, while the other character will have to succeed an [observation](#observation-perc) test. If the result is a tie, the one making the observation test is considered the **defender**, and wins. 

If a tie occurs in which a **defender** cannot be clearly determined, the result is a deadlock and neither side gains anything. 

The defender **cannot** [fork](#skill-forking) other skills into their test, whereas the attacker **can**.

### Providing Assistance
Characters can help each other in tests. In order to help with a test, a character must know a relevant [skill](#skills) and the one being helped must accept the help. 

Helping in a test works much like [forking](#skill-forking) a skill. The character being helped receives **+1D6** to roll for each *character* helping them. The number of relevant skills a helping character has is irrelevant. Just one is enough to allow them to help and only one **+1D6** is granted by the helping character. Which skill is used to help with, matters, however. 

If a **PC** is helping another, their player must describe *how* they're using their relevant skill to help. 

> For example, a **PC** is currently using their [thievery](#thievery-agi) to lockpick a door. Their allied **PC** is *helping*, by using their [observation](#observation-perc) skill to *keep an eye out for guards*, which allows the one on the door to work without having to constantly look over their shoulder. The **GM** finds that description agreeable and allows the use of the skill to help. 

Ultimately, whether a skill is appropriate to help with is determined by the **GM**. 

#### Helpers Learn
A character helping in a test, also gains [progress](#advancing-skills) towards the [skill](#skills) they've helped with. The outcome of the test for the character they helped, is their own outcome. 

> If the character who was helped succeeded their test, the helper also gains a successful test to mark on their skill. 

### Time
Not all tests are created equal - some actions require more time than others. 

While the **GM** decides on how much time a given test will need, the following guidelines should provide a good basis. 

* (Near) instantaneous: Combat actions, recalling knowledge, noticing things in passing. 
* A matter of minutes: inspecting an environment, quickly skimming the contents of a book, persuading someone in conversation, first aid. 
* A matter of hours: Simple crafts, surgery, scrutinizing an environment, researching something simple/not obscure, engaging in lengthy and difficult negotiations.
* A matter of days and months: Complex crafts and artistry, researching a complex or obscure subject. 

# Character
A character is a representation of a sentient creature in the game world. They're an amalgam of [attributes](#attributes), [skills](#skills), [ambitions, beliefs & instincts](#ambitions-beliefs--instincts) and of course their [possessions](#possessions--equipment). 

## Attributes
**Attributes** describe a character's basic, inherent abilities. 

The value of an attribute indicates the number of **D6** to roll for a test of that attribute. Attribute values typically range from 2 to 6 for ordinary human characters. 

**Attributes** [advance](#advancing-attributes), as they're tested. It is also possible to [practice](#practicing-attributes) **attributes**. It is **not** possible to teach **attributes**, however. 

Unlike [skills](#skills), it is not possible to [fork](#skill-forking) **attributes**. 

### Physical Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic physical abilities. 

#### Agility [Agi]
Determines how nimble, fast and flexible a character is. Any action that requires a character to move very precisely, will require agility. 

#### Endurance [End]
Governs how long a character can endure physical strains. 

For every point in endurance, a character raises their [Exhaustion Threshold](#exhaustion) by two. 

#### Perception [Perc]
Governs a character's ability to passively quickly pick up on fine and fleeting details in their environment or on objects and other characters. 

Also governs the ability to perceive under difficult conditions such as dim light and fog, or noisy and smelly environments. 

#### Strength [Str]
Governs a character's strength - the ability to lift, throw and break heavy and sturdy things. Such as skulls. Also governs the [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity) of a character. 

Each point in strength raises the [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity) of the character by 3. 

#### Toughness [Tough]
Governs the [injury threshold](#injury) of a character. 

For every point in [toughness](#toughness-tough), a character gains **+2 maximum HP**. 

For every two points in [toughness](#toughness-tough), a character raises their **Inj.** limit by 1. 

### Mental Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic mental abilities. 

#### Intelligence [Int]
Governs a character's ability to reason and analyze. 

#### Wisdom [Wis]
Governs a character's understanding of and ability to recall knowledge. 

#### Arcana [Arc]
Governs a character's ability to control and sense magic flow, thus casting magic spells or detecting lingering magic. 

This is the only attribute that can have a level of 0. Magical ability is innate and cannot be learned. If a character doesn't have a level of at least 1 in this attribute, they will be unable to advance it, at all. A non-mage will remain a non-mage (usually). 

### Social Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic social abilities. 

#### Empathy [Emp]
Governs a character's ability to read and understand another's emotions and intentions. 

#### Oratory [Ora]
Governs a character's ability to convincingly speak with and before others. Also used to manipulate others. 

#### Willpower [Will]
Governs a character's ability to withstand persuasion, intimidation, charm or terror. 

### Advancing Attributes
Whenever a **PC** uses an attribute in a [test](#tests), the outcome must be noted. 

Advancing an **attribute** requires:
* (N + 1) * (N + 1) * 3 **complete successess**.
* (N + 1) * (N + 1) * 4 **partial successess** or **complete failures**.
* Where *N* is the current level of the **attribute**. 

> A character has a [strength](#strength-str) **attribute** at level 3. 
> 
> To advance their **attribute** to level 4, they would need (3 + 1) * (3 + 1) * 3 = 48 **complete successes** and (3 + 1) * (3 + 1) * 4 = 64 **partial successess** or **complete failures**

For your convenience, the following table contains the precalculated requirements to advance an **attribute** level. 
* In the table, 'Level' is the character's *current level* in the **attribute**. 
* Note it is possible to go past level 10, but you shouldn't hope for it. 

| Level | Successes | Failures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 12  | 16  |
| 2   | 27  | 36  |
| 3   | 48  | 64  |
| 4   | 75  | 100 |
| 5   | 108 | 144 |
| 6   | 147 | 196 |
| 7   | 192 | 256 |
| 8   | 243 | 324 |
| 9   | 300 | 400 |
| 10  | 363 | 484 |

Whenever an attribute advances, its associated successes and failures must each be reset to 0. 

#### Practicing Attributes
It is possible to advance attributes *passively*. Whenever a large period of time is spent outside of active adventure, **PC**'s can practice an attribute of choice. 

A **PC** can only actively practice one **attribute**. Furthermore, a **PC** can not both be actively practicing an **attribute** *and* a **skill**. They must choose - either practice an **attribute** *or* a **skill**. 

For every **cycle** that passes of active practice, the **PC** can roll a [test](#tests) for the chosen **attribute**. 

A **cycle** is 2 Months, regardless of attribute being practiced. 

> A **PC** spends a year practicing their [arcana](#arcana-arc), while the **GM** prepares the next story arc. In this case, 5 tests can be made and their outcomes noted. 

## Skills
A **skill** is any acquired knowledge and experience regarding a specific subject. 

All of a character's **skills** have a value attached to them, which indicates the number of **D6** to use when testing that **skill**. Skill values typically range from 1 to 3 for most skills. 4 and 5 is very good, 6 is excellence and 7 and above is mastery. 

When [testing a skill](#tests), add half of the related [attribute](#attributes)'s value (rounded down) as number of additional dice for the test. 

**Skills** [advance](#advancing-skills), as they're tested. It is also possible to [practice](#practice) and [teach](#teaching) **skills**. 

It is also possible to [fork](#skill-forking) **skills**, granting more dice to roll in a test. 

### Skill Forking
For every **skill** a character knows (= is not currently still learning), and they are currently testing a **skill** that is thematically related, they can **fork** that **skill** into their test, granting them **+1D6** for their test. 

> Imagine a large forked rivermouth. One of the forks feeding into it is also a large river, which represents the **skill** primarily being tested. The other, smaller forks of the river represent the supporting **skills**. They all combine together at the rivermouth. A primary and supporting **skills** flow together into the test! 

> For example, if a character is testing their [thievery](#thievery-dex--perc--spd) **skill** at level three and they also know [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int), they can **fork** their stealth **skill** into their thievery test. Any number of **skills** can be **forked** into a test, but each **fork** only grants **+1D6**. For the thievery test above, it doesn't matter if the character is at stealth level one or five or nine-thousand. They only get a **+1D6** to their thievery test. So in this case, if the **GM** agrees, the player gets to roll **4D6** for their test. 

Which **skills** can be **forked** into a particular test is up to the **GM**. If a player is performing a test, they can lobby for the use of the **skills** they want to **fork** into their particular test, but ultimately, if the **GM** says no, that decision is final. 

> Back to the thievery example. Let's assume a **PC** is trying to quickly unlock a door using their [thievery](#thievery-dex--perc--spd), because they're being chased by guards and desperately need to get away. They could argue to fork their [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int) **skill** into the test, but ultimately, what use is stealth when you've already been detected? Unless you can make yourself *unseen* somehow, the **GM** should rule that stealth cannot apply in that situation. 

### Intent & Action
The players drive the story and the action. When deciding on what to do, make sure you state the **intent** of your action, like "I will make that person work for us!". 

Then, the **GM** will need to know how you aim to follow up on your intent. Describe the **action** you will take. The clearer, the better. "I will tell them of our exploits and how well we get paid!", is a good response and allows the **GM** to conclude you're trying to [persuade](#persuasion-emp) the other character. Even better would be something like "I will *persuade* them by telling them of our exploits and how well we get paid!" That leaves no room for doubt *how* you wish to achieve your goal. 

Of course, how appropriate a certain **skill** is for the resolution of a given situation, is ultimately up to the **GM** and the specifics of the situation itself. 

### Learning Skills
Whenever asked to test a skill a **PC** does not yet know, it will be added or progressed in the *currently learning* section of the character sheet. 

A skill in learning can only be tested with their related [attribute](#attributes). If multiple attributes are listed for a skill, you can choose which one to test with. 

A skill in learning must be tested at **double the** **Ob** than if it were a known skill. 

> A player is asked to test their character's [Leatherworking](#leatherworking-agi) at **Ob** 2. Their character lacks that skill and thus adds it to the *currently learning* section on their character sheet. Assuming their character has an agility of 3, they get to roll **3D6**. But since this is a skill being learned, the **Ob** must be doubled. 
> 
> The player cannot, mathematically, succeed a test at **Ob 4** with just **3D6**. Their character fails, but at least they learned a little from the attempt, which is noted on the skill in the *currently learning* section. 

The outcome of a test gets noted on the skill it was made for, not the attribute actually used for the test. 

**Forking** learning skills is not allowed. **Forking** into learning skills isn't allowed, either. 

It **is** possible to receive help or [tutoring](#teaching) on a learning skill. 

### Advancing Skills
Whenever a **PC** uses a **skill** in a [test](#tests), the outcome must be noted. 

Advancing a **skill** requires:
* (N + 1) * N * 2 **complete successess**.
* (N + 1) * N * 3 **partial successess** or **complete failures**.
* Where *N* is the current level of the attribute. 

> A character has a [nature](#nature-int) **skill** at level 2. 
> 
> To advance their **skill** to level 3, they would need (3 + 1) * 3 * 2 = 24 **complete successes** and (3 + 1) * 3 * 3 = 36 **partial successess** or **complete failures**

For your convenience, the following table contains the precalculated requirements to advance a **skill** level. 
* In the table, 'Level' is the character's *current level* in the **skill**. 
* Note it is possible to go past level 10, but you shouldn't hope for it. 
* Note that level 0 requirements do not follow the formula above, instead being 10/14 (S/F). 

| Level | Successes | Failures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 10  | 14  |
| 1   | 4   | 6   |
| 2   | 12  | 18  |
| 3   | 24  | 36  |
| 4   | 40  | 60  |
| 5   | 60  | 90  |
| 6   | 84  | 126 |
| 7   | 112 | 168 |
| 8   | 144 | 216 |
| 9   | 180 | 270 |
| 10  | 220 | 330 |

Whenever a skill advances, its associated successes and failures must each be reset to 0. 

#### Practice
It is possible to advance skills *passively*. Whenever a large period of time is spent outside of active adventure, **PC**'s can practice a skill of choice. 

A **PC** can only actively practice one **category of skills**. For every **cycle** that passes of active practice, the **PC** can roll a [test](#tests) of a skill of the corresponding category. Furthermore, a **PC** can not both be actively practicing a **skill** *and* an **attribute**. They must choose - either practice a **skill** *or* an **attribute**. 

| Skill Category | Cycle    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Physical       | 3 Weeks  |
| Social         | 2 Weeks  |
| Craftsmanship  | 1 Month  |
| Knowledge      | 2 Months |

> A **PC** spends seven weeks practicing their [fighting](#fighting-str), while waiting for their comrade to recover from their [injuries](#injury). [Fighting](#fighting-str) being a physical skill, the cycle for tests is 3 weeks. In this case, 2 tests can be made and their outcomes noted. 

#### Teaching
Much like it is possible for a character to [practice](#practice) on their own, they can also be taught by another, who knows more than them. 

Both teacher and pupil must actively spend time together, furthering the pupil's skill. The rules for cycle and test are the same as with [practice](#practice). The cycles noted in the table below are used instead. 

| Skill Category | Cycle    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Physical       | 2 Weeks  |
| Social         | 1 Week   |
| Craftsmanship  | 3 Weeks  |
| Knowledge      | 1 Month  |

If the teacher's skill is at least one level higher than that of their student, the student can use an extra **+1D6** to resolve their tests of the skill they're being taught. 

## Ambitions, Beliefs & Instincts
While all characters are expected to have *ambitions*, *beliefs* and *instincts*, **PC**s are special, because for them, these concepts are cemented through rules and mechanics. 

**Ambitions**, **beliefs** and **instincts** can not change during a game session. They can only be changed in-between. 

Whenever a player plays to their **ambitions**, **beliefs** and **instincts** in certain ways, they earn [fate points](#fate-points). 

It is the **GM**'s role, to create interesting situations, which can *challenge* the **beliefs** and **instincts**, or even **ambitions** of the **PC**s. However the players and **PC**s react, can earn them [fate points](#fate-points) and will drive the story forward. 

### Ambition
Every **PC** must have one **ambition** - a life-fulfilling long-term goal to pursue. This can be anything from "found a family" to "become king of the world!". No matter how unrealistic, an **ambition** is a primary driver for a character, to guide them onward. The important part is to think *big*. Something easily achievable would make for a dull **ambition** and defeat the point of it. 

An **ambition** is not expected to change often. An ideal **ambition** would accompany a character a long time. 

### Beliefs
A player also has to decide on three **beliefs** for their character, which represent short-term goals and expectations of the character and their player. A belief should not be a triviality, but instead a goal that requires some considerable effort on both the character's and player's part to achieve. 

A belief must be based on the events and circumstances affecting the character in game. 

> For example, a **PC** learns of a conspiracy against their lord during the session. After the session, they decide they'll change one of their **beliefs** to "I will uncover the plot against my lord!"

**Beliefs** can also target other **PC**s. You can either set a belief to help or even change your fellow **PC**. Be mindful though, your belief should not be *too* drastic.

> For example, a **PC** learns their ally is a member of a secretive and dangerous cult. After the session, the player determines the new belief "I will get my ally to leave that dangerous cult!" Whether successful or not, this belief, in play, will create an **interesting conflict** between the two **PC**s. 

**Beliefs** are expected to change frequently, commonly from session to session. But not so frequent as to make achieving them impossible. 

### Instincts
Much like [beliefs](#beliefs), a player must determine three **instincts** for their character. 

An **instinct** represents an automatic reaction from the character, given a situation that triggers it. They can be seen as "if/then" and "always/never" statements. These can either be beneficial or detrimental to the character. 
* A detrimental **instinct** acts as a *troublemaker* and allows earning [fate points](#fate-points). 
* A beneficial **instinct** acts as *insurance*, but doesn't allow earning [fate points](#fate-points). 

> For example: "Whenever someone praises the state religion, I start ranting against it." - This is a detrimental **instinct**, as the **GM** can use that to cause the **PC** trouble. 

> Another example: "Whenever a lethal fight breaks out, I have my weapons in hand!" - This is insurance, that even when the **PC** narratively might not have their weapons at the ready, they will, in fact, have them at the ready. 

Ideally, an **instinct** should be (ab-)usable by the **GM**, to get the **PC** into *trouble* easier. This is to be taken with a wink, though. A **GM** is expected to craft an *interesting* story and thus create *interesting* conundrums for the players and their characters, with a realistic chance for the players and their characters to maneuver themselves back out of trouble. 

**Instincts** are expected to change whenever a character (decides) to act against them. A **PC** cannot keep an instinct they keep contradicting. 

## Health & Exhaustion
Every character has **Hit Points (HP)** and a maximum number of **Injuries (Inj.)** they can endure, before they die. 

Whenever a character is hurt, the **damage** that has been inflicted upon them is deducted from their **HP**. Whenever their **HP** reach zero, they suffer an **Inj.** and their **maximum HP** is reduced by **N\*2**, where *N* is the number of **Inj.** they currently have. So, in other words, for every **Inj.**, a character loses 2 maximum **HP**. Any **HP** past zero overflow, so the damage dealt isn't lost. 

When [Toughness](#toughness-tough) is reduced, still only 2 maximum **HP** are deducted. 

Outside of combat, a successful [medicine](#medicine-int) test can restore all currently missing **HP** of a character. 

### Injury
An **injury (Inj.)** is a serious health impediment of a character. Every character has a maximum number of **Inj.** they can endure. If they reach their maximum number of **Inj.**, the character dies. **PC**s are an exception, who instead arrive at [death's door](#deaths-door). 

Whenever a character suffers an **Inj.**, a **D100** must be rolled and the corresponding result from the [list of injuries](#list-of-injuries) added to the character. Depending on the type of damage and the situation in question, a different injury table may be rolled on, instead. Such as the [burn injuries](#list-of-burn-injuries). 

An **Inj.** can reduce [attributes](#attributes) and impose other restrictions. An [attribute](#attributes) cannot be brought down to less than 1, by **Inj.**

#### Injury States
There are four possible states of an **Inj.**: **active**, **patched up**, **treated** or **permanent**. 

Only an **active** **Inj.** imposes negative effects. 

An **Inj.** can be **patched up** via [medicine](#medicine-int):
* If the attempt is a complete success, the **Inj.** is **patched up**.
* If the attempt is a partial success or a complete failure, the **Inj.** remains **active**. 

A **patched up** **Inj.** still reduces a character's **maximum HP** and must be counted when checking whether they must perform their [toughness](#toughness-tough) test when suffering more injuries. 

An **Inj.** can be properly **treated** via [surgery](#surgery-int): 
* If the attempt is a complete success, the **Inj.** is **treated**. 
* If the attempt is a partial success, the **Inj.** is not **treated**, but another attempt can be made. 
* If the attempt is a complete failure, the **Inj.** becomes **permanent**. It cannot be **treated** via [surgery](#surgery-int) anymore. 
* Only one [surgery](#surgery-int) attempt can be made every 24 hours. 

All currently **treated**  Inj.** can be removed/recovered from, by spending **4D4** weeks in uninterrupted, active recovery. Active recovery implies spending the vast majority of the day in bed or at least avoiding physical and mental strains. 

#### Injury Exhaustion Threshold
Once a character is brought to at least half their maximum number of **Inj.** (rounded up), every time past that point that they suffer further damage and/or injury they must succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test with twice their number of injuries as the **Ob**, or else suffer +1 [exhaustion](#exhaustion). This point in time is called the **injury exhaustion threshold**. 

> A character is injured in combat. They have an **injury** threshold of 3 and already suffered an injury earlier. Even though the earlier injury may have been **patched up** by now, the character's new injury brings them up to a total of 2 injuries. 
> 
> This means that they've reached their **injury exhaustion threshold**. Now, when they're wounded again in combat, they must succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test at **Ob** 4, or else suffer +1 [exhaustion](#exhaustion). 

### Exhaustion
Exhaustion is the measure of a character's maximum physical and mental strain they can endure. 

If a character's exhaustion reaches their threshold, they become [dazed](#dazed) from over-exertion. 

Exhaustion is gained through performing **exhausting actions**, carrying **exhausting equipment** or suffering [injuries](#injury). 

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions** can be reduced by resting. A full rest of at least **six uninterrupted hours** will fully clear any exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions**. 

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting equipment**, can be reduced, by dropping the equipment in question and resting for a short while, at the **GM**'s discretion. A character trying to carry more than they can endure, should not immediately fall unconscious, mind you. Apply common sense - the character in question would probably try to carry the extra equipment, only find out right away it is simply too much for them. 

### Status Effects
Characters can have one or more **status effect(s)** affecting them. A **status effect** can have positive or negative effects on the character. 

#### Dazed
A **dazed** character begins their turn with -2 **AP** and can run at most only half the distance they normally could. In addition, they suffer a penalty of **-1D** to all tests. The number of dice for a test cannot be reduced to less than 1 by this penalty. 

#### Unconscious
An **unconscious** character is unable to act and is unaware of their surroundings. 

Someone *knocked* **unconscious** can't awaken due to external stimuli and have to recover, first. For how long, depends on the circumstances. But several hours hould be a good baseline. 

#### Grappled
A **grappled** character is unable to move and suffers -1 [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi), for as long as they are **grappled**. A **grappled** character can break free, by **completely succeeding** a [strength](#strength-str) test against the other character grappling them. 

#### Hasted
A **hasted** character enjoys several benefits.

During combat, the character has an additional **AP** to spend and an additional 9'/3m of movement per **AP**. 

Out of combat, the character enjoys greater speed of movement. 

#### Death's Door
**Death's door** is a state only a **PC** can enter and represents their final battle with death. 

A **PC** at **death's door** must succeed at least one [toughness](#toughness-tough) test out of a possible of three. If they never succeed, they perish, irrevocably*. 
* If the character is at **death's door** during [combat](#combat), they must make a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test at the end of every round. 
* If the character is at **death's door** out of [combat](#combat), they must make a test every minute. 

A character can be helped out of **death's door**, if all of their **active** **Inj.** are **patched up** or **treated**. For every **active** **Inj.** that is **patched up** or **treated**, the character gains one more attempt to succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test. 

\* A **very** powerful mage could bring them back using [soul-binding](#soul-binding-int). 

#### Frostbite
This status effect can stack! That means, it can be incurred multiple times! 

For every point of **frostbite**, 1 point of **freezing** damage is incurred every combat round. 

Also for every point of **frostbite**, a -1 **AP** penalty is incurred, up to a maximum of -3. 

At the end of every round of combat, one point of **frostbite** is removed, until the status effect is removed completely. 

#### Rooted
A **rooted** character can no longer move their legs. They cannot move from the spot, but can still move their upper body freely. 

This status-effect is usually tied to some condition, before it is removed. 

#### Terrified
A **terrified** character suffers -2D to both their melee and ranged defence and **has to** run away from whatever it is that terrified them. 

This status effect lasts until either the source of terror is removed or until it is successfully [resisted](#resist-will). 

#### Berserk
A character who is in **berserk**, **must** attack the creature nearest to them. 

This status effect lasts until it is successfully [resisted](#resist-will) or the character is made [unconscious](#unconscious). 

#### Pacified
A character who is **pacified**, is unable to *willingly* take any action that would directly or indirectly harm any other creature. 

Note, the character is not physically unable to cause harm, but they **really** don't want to. 

This status effect lasts until it is successfully [resisted](#resist-will) or the character is made [unconscious](#unconscious). 

#### Jealous
A character who has been made unnaturally **jealous**, will do anything in their power to take, whatever it may be, from whoever might have *it*. 

This status effect lasts until it is successfully [resisted](#resist-will) or the character is made [unconscious](#unconscious). 

### Illness
An illness can affect a character over a perod of time and cause various negative effects. 

Illness can be contracted in a variety of ways, although most of them involve an open wound exposed to bacterial breeding grounds, such as bogs, sewers, mass graves and trash dumps. Or from something ingested, such as spoiled or poisoned food. 

When a character is about to contract an illness, they most make a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test:
* On a **complete success**, the illness is shrugged off. 
* On a **partial success** or **complete failure**, the illness is contracted and will immediately apply its effects to the character. 
* If they contracted the illness, determine which one by rolling a **D100** and picking the corresponding illness from the [list of illnesses](#list-of-illnesses). 
  * Once the illness has been determined, its duration and severity must also be rolled. 

Most illnesses have a duration, during which their effects are active and after which, all ill-effects go away. In some cases, an illness may have a duration of "until cured", which means it will never go away, if not treated. 

Treatment of an illness is possible through [medicine](#medicine-int) or [surgery](#surgery-int). Which skill is required, will be noted on the illness. Treatment will often be able to reduce the ill-effects and sometimes to remove the illness, altogether. A treatment attempt can only be made once every 24 hours. 

Any illness, that when treated has its duration reduced, can only have its duration reduced once. If a treatment would also suspend any ill-effects, that would still be applicable. That way, treating an illness which already had its duration reduced can still be useful. 

### Damage Types
All damage inflicted, is inflicted with a certain type of damage. 

| Damage Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Slashing    | Usually inflicted by any sort of cutting/slashing weapon, like a sword, or a talon. |
| Piercing    | Usually inflicted by any sort of stabbing weapon, like a spear, or an animal's stinger. |
| Bludgeoning | Inflicted by light blunt weapons and unarmed attacks. **Bludgeoning** causes non-lethal damage. It inflicts [exhaustion](#exhaustion) instead of [injuries](#injury). A [dazed](#dazed) character hit with **bludgeoning** damage has to succeed an [endurance](#endurance-end) test, or else fall [unconscious](#unconscious). |
| Crushing    | Usually inflicted by any sort of heavy blunt weapon, like a hammer, or an animal's tusks. |
| Burning     | Inflicted by extreme heat. For [injuries](#injury), roll on the [burn injuries](#list-of-burn-injuries) table. |
| Freezing    | Inflicted by extreme cold. |
| Poison      | Usually represents a [damage over time effect](#damage-over-time). |
| Acid        | Dissolves anything it touches, or perhaps just organic matter. |

### Damage Over Time
Also known as *damage over time* or *status effect*, these are [damage types](#damage-types), which inflict injuries over a set period of time. 

Every **damage over time** has an **intensity level**. The intensity governs how many injuries a afflicted character/creature suffers and at which intervals. 

| Damage Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Bleeding    | One point of **damage** per intensity level, per round of **combat**, or every minute. |
| Poisoned    | One point of **damage** per intensity level, per round of **combat**, or every minute. |

### Damage Resistances
Some creatures can resist certain [types of damage](#damage-types) naturally, while others may cover themselves in armor to the same effect. 

How much **damage** is resisted, depends on the specifics of the creature or character and their [equipment](#possessions--equipment). 

## Possessions & Equipment
A character may have things on their persion, such as worn equipment, as well as the things they *own*. 

### Money
Money is generalized as **crowns**, with no regard for regional currencies. The following table gives a brief overview of the value of **crowns**. 

Keep in mind most of the really expensive things are usually paid for not in **crowns**, but rather in favors, fealty or rare items. 

| Cost Range | Goods                      | Services                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1-10       | Unprocessed foods; Very common things | Simple Lodgings; Sending a message a short distance with a messenger; Peasant's and hireling pay |
| 10-50      | Low to medium quality alcoholic drinks; A proper, warm meal; Simple tools and items; Simple weapons, like a dagger or woodcutter's axe; Plain clothes or cloth; Farm animals; Somewhat common things | Lodgings in a private room; Private services; Simple equipment repairs; Travel by carriage or stagecoach; A simple guard's pay |
| 50-100     | Light armor; Decorated clothes; Weapons; Shields; Fine drinks; Lordly meals; Decorative silver things; Low-quality gems; Horses; Books and Scriptures; Uncommon things | Medical services; An elite guard's pay |
| 100-500    | Medium to heavy armor; Well-made weapons; Decorative gold things; High-quality gems; Carefully bred war-steeds; Small building in a large city; Rare things |  |
| 500-1000   | Decorated armor; Decorated well-made weapons; Large building in a large city; [Magic runes](#runes); Very rare things |  |

### Carrying Capacity
Characters have **item slots** that determine how much they can carry. How many **item slots** they have, is determined by their [strength](#strength-str). The number of **item slots** a character has is referred to as the **carrying capacity**. 

Most things will take up one **slot**, which equals something around 5lb/2kg, but some particularly large and/or heavy items can take up more **slots**. How many **slots** an item takes up, is referred to as **bulk**. 

> An item with **bulk** 2 takes up 2 **item slots**. 

So, while most items, such as tools, a day's rations, or books have only 1 **bulk**, armor and weapons typically have more. 

Up to 100 [crowns](#money) can fit into one **slot**. 

> A **PC** has 56 **crowns**, those all go into 1 **slot**. Their ally is significantly wealthier, with 314 **crowns**, which take up 4 **item slots**.

It is up to the **GM** to decide on when something is *too heavy* to carry for the character in question. 

## Character Creation
Imagine for the longest time of their life, your character has led an ordinary existence, until one day, something life-changing happened. Perhaps something terrible, perhaps something wonderful, but something significant that has forced them out of their comfort zone into a world full of adventure. 

Creating an interesting and life-like character is a challenging, but ultimately, very rewarding task. Thinking of their existence up to the point they start adventuring, can really help with paving the path of their future and give you a good idea of what they're like, and why.

If you don't feel inspired, the following sections can provide tips and randomization tables that allow you write up a character more quickly. 

The procedure of creating a character consists of the following steps:
1. [Determine life path](#determine-life-path). 
2. [Determine name & personality](#determine-name--personality).
3. [Determine species, sex & appearance](#species-sex--appearance).
4. [Determine **ambition**, **beliefs** & **instincts**](#choosing-ambition-beliefs--instincts). 
5. [Determine **attributes**](#choosing-attributes).
6. [Determine **skills**](#choosing-skills).
7. [Determine **carrying capacity** and **possessions**](#carrying-capactity--possessions).
8. [Determine **Max HP** and **Max Inj.**](#determine-max-hp--max-inj)
9. [Determine exhaustion threshold](#determine-exhaustion-threshold).
10. [Determine magic stamina](#determine-magic-stamina).

### Determine Life Path
Where and when does the story of your character begin? Under what circumstances are they born and how were they raised? Until adulthood, did they lead a life of carelessness or did they have to fight for every scrap of food? How did they lead their life up until the point they picked up adventuring? 

Answering these questions will help you figure out what your character could be like, as a person and what kinds of **ambitions**, **beliefs** and **instincts** they might develop. 

If you need inspiration, the following tables might help a spark along:
#### Origin
| Range D6 | Origin | 
| -------- | ------ |
| 1 | You were born into the life of a noble. |
| 2 | You were born as the only child of a merchant. |
| 3 | You were found as an orphaned infant and grew up in the hands of a kind foster family. |
| 4 | You were found as an abandoned infant at the doors to an orphanage. |
| 5 | You were born as the fifth child of a farmer. |
| 6 | You were born to a craftsman. |

#### Youth
| Range D10 | Youth | 
| --------- | --------- |
| 1 | You developed a passion for a craft and found a master willing to teach you his art. |
| 2 | You never quite found your place in the world and never found a passion for honest work. Instead, you took to a life of lowly crime, pickpocketing and extorting what you could. |
| 3 | You spent much time with books and scrolls, reading about the world and its wonders. |
| 4 | You were drafted into the military and remained in service for a few years. |
| 5 | You went where the wind took you, doing lowly hireling pay when necessary and otherwise exploring and enjoying life as it came. |
| 6 | You preferred life in the wilderniss and either took to the hermit's life or simply camped out in the woods as much as possible. |
| 7 | You were wrongfully imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit. Or, perhaps, you did? |
| 8 | You, by chance, met a mage, who sensed your lust for power. They taught you their knowledge, in secret, whenever they were available. |
| 9 | You found yourself wanting to better the world. You helped others where possible and eventually picked up on the healing arts, perhaps even learning under a tutor. |
| 10 | You were taught by a wealthy and successful merchant (perhaps your parent) and helped with running their business for a few years. |

#### The Last Few Years
| Range D6 | The Last Few Years | 
| -------- | --------- |
| 1 | You made an enemy you couldn't beat and were thus forced to leave town. Since then, you've been on the run. |
| 2 | You've been given an important task to carry out in secret. A piece of parchment holds your orders, but the task is simply too great for you to complete on your own. |
| 3 | You've found yourself with an insatiable curiosity and decided to go see the world and its wonders. |
| 4 | You decided to go on a pilgrimage, but were distracted from your path. |
| 5 | You swore an oath and intend to keep it. You swore to rescue someone, or bring honor to your clan, or perhaps to bring justice to a known criminal. |
| 6 | You lost someone or something you held dear. Now, you're on a quest to get it back, or your revenge. |

### Determine Name & Personality
Any interesting character should have an interesting name. Whether you set a name or personality first, is entirely up to you. Although, you might prefer to delay this step until much later, once you've determined the other aspects of your character. Whichever you find easier is fine. 

If you can't come up with a name, you can ask your **GM** for inspiration, since they'll likely know the world and the culture(s) your character can stem from and what kinds of names are common there. 

Perhaps more important than the name, is the personality that it represents. Think about what you want your character to be like - are they very sociable? Or perhaps a taciturn brute who'd rather let their actions speak? What ideals do they have? A virtue and perhaps a vice? How do they speak? Do they stutter? 

| Range D10 | Virtue      | Vice       | Speech     |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1         | Courageous  | Cowardly   | Blunt      |
| 2         | Courteous   | Cruel      | Boisterous |
| 3         | Disciplined | Greedy     | Formal     |
| 4         | Honest      | Irascible  | Gravelly   |
| 5         | Honorable   | Prejudiced | Mumbling   |
| 6         | Humble      | Reckless   | Precise    |
| 7         | Righteous   | Wasteful   | Rambling   |
| 8         | Loyal       | Vengeful   | Dialect    |
| 9         | Just        | Arrogant   | Stuttering |
| 10        | Merciful    | Vain       | Rapid-fire |

### Species, Sex & Appearance
Species is a bit difficult to provide a randomization table for, because the world your **GM** is running, might have different species available, than could be anticipated here. For simplicity's sake, it is assumed you are generating a human here. 

Gender is personal preference, but could also be decided by a coin flip. 

| Range D10 | Physique    | Face       | Skin       | Hair     |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1         | Athletic    | Bloated    | Scar       | Bald     |
| 2         | Brawny      | Blunt      | Birthmark  | Braided  |
| 3         | Corpulent   | Bony       | Makeup     | Curly    |
| 4         | Delicate    | Chiseled   | Tattooed   | Cropped  |
| 5         | Gaunt       | Delicate   | Weathered  | Frizzy   |
| 6         | Hulking     | Elongated  | Perfect    | Long     |
| 7         | Lanky       | Patrician  | Tanned     | Ponytail |
| 8         | Stout       | Pinched    | War Paint  | Oily     |
| 9         | Short       | Narrow     | Pale       | Wavy     |
| 10        | Scrawny     | Broken     | Pierced    | Greased  |

### Choosing Ambition, Beliefs & Instincts
As described in the [section with the same name](#ambitions-beliefs--instincts), what your character believes in and what drives them onward, is key in playing them. Don't worry too much about your first **beliefs** and **instincts**, they're expected to change frequently, anyway. 

Only your **ambition** will require some thought beforehand, but even so, you don't have to plan your character's future, at all. That is the **GM**'s job, after all. But keep in mind your character's **ambition** tells your **GM**, what kind of stories you'd like to explore and what's more, how your character will fit into them. 

#### Choosing an Ambition
At the core of every character stands their [ambition](#ambition), which is the primary force driving them. A good **ambition** should last you a long time and give the **GM** a hint what kind of story you want to explore with your character. 

Talk to your **GM** about the **ambition** you want your character to have. On the one hand, it allows them to determine the kind of story you want to explore and on the other hand they can guage whether the **ambition** is a suitable long-term goal. 

Keep in mind the **ambition** you can randomly determine here is kept most basic and generic. Work with your **GM** to fill in the details. 

| Range D10 | Ambition           | 
| --------- | ------------------ | 
| 1         | Revenge            | 
| 2         | Pilgrimage         | 
| 3         | Wealth             | 
| 4         | Power              | 
| 5         | Fame/Glory         | 
| 6         | Knowledge          | 
| 7         | Family & Belonging | 
| 8         | Atonement          | 
| 9         | World Betterment   | 
| 10        | Fire               | 

#### Choosing Beliefs
Now, the time to determine your three [beliefs](#beliefs) has come. Yet again, your **GM** is integral in finding them. However, the other **PC**s are also of interest now. You can have **beliefs** whose subject is one of the other **PC**s. You could have the game begin with two or more of the **PC**s knowing each other. 

A good **belief** has a *subject* and a well-defined *goal*. It doesn't necessarily matter if the goal is attainable, though. Unlike an **ambition**, a **belief** doesn't have to be long-term, at all. If it comes up during play, you could achieve your **belief** within the first session. On the other hand, some **beliefs** never come to fruition. 

> Two **PC**s begin the game knowing each other. One starts with a background as a criminal, the other as a former monk. The former monk has a **belief** stating "Stealing isn't right! I will help my friend pick up honest work!" The thief, on the other hand has the **belief** "My friend has my back, but they really need to start looking after themselves! I will teach them to be more like me." 
> 
> These two **beliefs** allow these characters to come into conflict, despite their good intentions. How it will play out, no one can say. And that makes for an interesting conflict!

#### Choosing Instincts
Lastly, you need three [instincts](#instincts) for your character. Ideally, at least one of them should allow your **GM** getting your **PC** into *trouble*. 

### Choosing Attributes
There are two methods for determining your character's attributes: manual and semi-random. 

Also, you'll have to decide on whether your character will be a mage or not. Mages start with lower attributes, so this decision can affect your character's initial competence. 

Please keep in mind the values here are representative for an ordinary human about to enter an adventuring life. Other species may have modifiers on their attributes, making them better or worse in some of them. But that depends on the world your **GM** is running. 

#### Manual Attribute Assignment
* As a mage
  * You can spend 15 points on your attributes. 
  * All attributes start at level 2. 
  * **Arcana** starts at level 1. 
  * Your attribute-total cannot be greater than **36**.
* As a non-mage
  * You can spend 18 points on your attributes. 
  * All attributes *except arcana* start at level 2. Arcana is 0 and remains 0. 
  * Your attribute-total cannot be greater than **38**.
* No attribute may have a level less than 2 nor higher than 6.
* Only two attributes may have a level of 6. 

#### Semi-Random Attribute Assignment
1. For a mage
   1. Roll 11 **D6**
2. For a non-mage
   1. Roll 10 **D6**
3. Row up your dice to form a line, then read them from one end to the other and note each value. The order in which they are written down, is the order in which they'll be applied to the attributes. 
4. If there are more than 2 6s, start lowering their value by one, starting from the left or the right, until there are only 2 6s left. 
5. Count up the total of your values. 
   1. For a mage subtract your total from **36**. <br>
   For a non-mage subtract your total from **38**.
   2. If the number is negative, that's the number of levels you'll have to go down. <br>
   If the number is positive, that's the number of levels you'll have to go up. 
6. Starting from the left or right, start adjusting each value.
   1. If your levels have to go down, subtract one from each value. **But** don't adjust 6s, 2s or 1s. 
   2. If your levels have to go up, add one to each value. **But** don't adjust 6s. If there are less than 2 6s, up to two 5s may be raised to a 6, otherwise, don't adjust 5s. 
7. Any remaining 1s have to be turned into 2s, then repeat from step 5. 
8. Lastly, apply the adjusted values to your attributes. 

#### Determine Attribute Advancing Thresholds
Once attribute values have been set, you can determine the required number of successes and failures each attribute requires, in order to advance. 

For this, see the rules on [attribute advancing](#advancing-attributes).

### Choosing Skills
You can spend **8** points to *learn* skills and raise their level, with the following limitations:
* No skill can be at level 4 or higher.
* You can have at most 5 skills. 
* No skills can be set to *learning*.
* Skills *should* relate to your character's life path, but don't *have to*. 

Once you've chosen skills, you can determine the required number of successes and failures each skill requires, in order to advance. 

For this, see the rules on [skill advancing](#advancing-skills).

### Carrying Capactity & Possessions
First, determine your character's maximum [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity). Refer to the [strength](#strength-str) attribute to do so. 

You can add things your character starts the game with. It is best to start with weapon(s), armor, shield and necessities, like food rations and torches. 

However, there some limitations:
* Max 20 **bulk** total.
* Only one armor.
* Only one weapon of **bulk** 3+ OR two weapons of **bulk** 1 or **bulk** 2.
* Only one shield.

### Determine Max HP & Max Inj
Determine your character's **max HP** and **injury limit**, by referring to the [toughness](#toughness-tough) attribute. 

All characters start with an **injury limit** of 1. 

### Determine Exhaustion Threshold
Determine your character's [exhaustion threshold](#exhaustion), by referring to the [endurance](#endurance-end) attribute. 

### Determine Magic Stamina
Determine your character's **maximum magic stamina**, by referring to the [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) section. 

You'll need to track **current magic stamina** separately. To start with, set your current to your maximum **magic stamina**. 

# Fate Points
Fate points (**FP**) represent a meta-currency that *players* can earn and use to buy boons for their character or the group as a whole. 

There are three types of **FP**: [Minor](#minor-fate-points), [major](#major-fate-points) and [ambition](#ambition-fate-points). 

**FP** are earned, by playing to one's [ambitions, beliefs and instincts](#ambitions-beliefs--instincts). Most **FP** are earned by a single player, but some may also be earned as a group. 

## Minor Fate Points
**Minor Fate Points (MiFP)** are the lowest valued and most common type of **FP**, most commonly earned by playing the mechanics of the game. 

**MiFP** can be earned in the following ways: 
* **Beliefs**: Playing to one's **beliefs**. This only counts *working towards* a goal set by a belief. 
* **Trouble**: Playing to one's **instincts** - if they get their character, or their allies, into trouble. 
* **Humor**: Stopping the table with a good bit of humor at the right time. But don't overdo it - your **GM** can only weave you a dramatic and gripping story, if you let them. 
* **Specialist**: Driving the story forward, when no one else could - having the right skill to employ at the right time. 
* **Helper**: Helping an ally out at a critical time - during or out of [combat](#combat). 

## Major Fate Points
**Major Fate Points (MaFP)** take more effort from the *player* to earn, only being earned through convincing roleplaying, creative efforts and accomplishing long-term goals. 

**MaFP** can be earned in the following ways: 
* **Beliefs**: Accomplishing a goal set by a belief. 
* **Achievements**: Whenever a major plot point or story arc is concluded - a great journey, uncovering a plot of assassination, fulfilling a contract to clear out a bandit camp or discovering an ancient artifact, all count as *achievements*, which earn this award **for all the players, as a group**. 
* **Embodiment**: Capturing their character and personifying them, in the moment. For example, by giving a great speech, acting scared or enjoying a bitter revenge with glee, as if they were actually there and doing it! 
* **Inner Turmoil**: Convincingly acting out an inner conflict that may come up when a decision that conflicts with a **belief** comes up. If the others can *feel* the gut-wrenching decision being made, this award is earned!
* **Creative Solutions**: Coming up with a very creative way to solve a problem. This may be a diplomatic solution, where the **GM** thought one impossible. Or, perhaps an unexpected use of the environment during **combat**, which earned the **PC**s a distinct advantage on the battlefield, in a way the **GM** couldn't foresee. 
* **Collaboration**: Working with the **GM** to further the world and the story in creative ways and helping the **GM** out when possible. Secret plots that only one of the players is involved in, which causes gasps and applause from the other players, when the plot is finally revealed, for example. 
* **The Gears**: Being *the gears*, without which nothing would move. Doing the laborious work during session, nobody wants to do, but which has to happen to keep the story moving. Always making sure to pitch the tents in the right spot, watching out for traps or doing the boring question-asking all earn this award!

## Ambition Fate Points
**Ambition Fate Points (AFP)** are very rare and only earned through outstanding achievements. 

**AFP** can be earned in the following ways: 
* **World-Shaper**: Changing the world around oneself in a significant way. 
* **Selfless**: Going above and beyond to achieve something, a betterment, not for oneself, but for others and at great cost. 
* **Achiever**: Achieving and thus concluding an **ambition**. 

## Hand of Fate
The **Hand of Fate** is a deck of cards a player can draw from, using their **FP** as currency to buy cards. 

A player can play any of their cards whenever appropriate. A played card is discarded. 

There are no limits to how many of a given card a player can own, but they may only hoard a maximum of 5 cards at a time. 

| Cost    | Name               | Effect             |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 3 MiFP  | Single Re-Roll     | Re-Roll a single **negative** die. |
| 6 MiFP  | Clotter            | One **active Inj.** of choice is now **patched up**. |
| 1 MaFP  | Fact Check         | Change a minor plot point in a way your prefer. Work with your **GM** to make sure it fits the narrative, but they should respect your wish. This could be something like avoiding an **NPC** death or changing a fact about the plot. |
| 1 MaFP  | Just a Flesh Wound | Remove or avoid one non-permanent **Inj.** of choice. |
| 1 MaFP  | Hastened           | +1 **AP** during your turns for the entirety of a [combat](#combat) encounter. |
| 5 MaFP  | Double the Fun     | Double the number of dice to roll on your next/current test. |
| 10 MaFP | Wrong Diagnosis    | Remove or avoid one permanent **Inj.** of choice. |
| 1 AFP   | Defy Death         | Leap from [death's door](#deaths-door), remove 1 **active Inj.** of choice and be at 1 **HP**; Alternatively, avoid a narratively-driven death. The **GM** will decide the character's alternative fate. They could be captured, very badly injured or become indebted to someone or something. |
| 1 AFP   | Yes, my liege      | Work with your **GM** to create a follower/hireling who will now be at your command/employ. |

# Combat
When diplomacy fails, hostilities ensue. 

## Who Acts When
At the beginning of every combat encounter, the involved parties (= groups) must roll for initiative. In order to determine which party gets to act first, each party rolls a **D100**. The party rolling the higher number, goes first. If there is a tie, roll another **D100**. 

The involved parties act one after another. After all involved parties have had their **turn** to act, a **combat round** has passed. All members of a party act at the same time, during the party's turn. 

If one party is surprised, the ambushing party gets to act for a full turn, without initiative being rolled. This is called a *surprise round*. After the surprise round, initiative is rolled and combat begins as explained above. A party is considered surprised if they were unaware of their opponents when the first attack roll happens. 

> As an example: this does not count for opponents standing right in front of each other in conversation, when one of them suddenly draws a dagger and attacks. The attacker can be clearly seen by the defender and thus they must both roll for initiative, to determine whether the defender can react in time. 

## Combat Actions
Every turn, every character gets 3 **Action Points (AP)** to spend on actions during their turn. 

Any basic action, so any action not requiring a test, costs 1 **AP**. Any action requiring a test, costs 2 **AP**. Skill abilities cost the amount of **AP** as noted on them. 

Speaking or shouting a short phrase is free. If you want to have a proper conversation, that will have to take multiple rounds. 

If the turn is ended with any **AP** unspent, they can either be saved up, or spent on improving the character's [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) and [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi), as **+1D6** per **AP**. 

Only up to 5 AP may be saved up this way. It may be possible to go past this limit via some skill abilities. 

### Combat Movement
A character can move up to **18'/6m** per **AP** spent. In **difficult terrain**, the distance moved per **AP** is half that, at **9'/3m**. 

## How to Attack
Attacks are made using a [weapon skill](#weapon--weapon-type--str), [magic-school skill](#magic-school--school---attribute-) or a **skill-ability**. 

Defending against [single-target attacks](#single-target-attack) is an automatic reaction. An [opposed test](#opposed-test) must be made. 

Defending against [area of effect attacks](#area-of-effect-attack) is either impossible or an active choice, as a reaction. <br>
It is possible to defend against a magical **aoe** attack, by using the [counter-magic](#counter-magic) skill. If successful, the attack is negated entirely. 

If the attacker wins the [opposed test](#opposed-test) or if they used an **aoe** attack that couldn't/wasn't countered or dodged, they get to roll for damage. If the defender wins, no damage is dealt. 

[Unarmed combat](#unarmed) is handled like a weapon skill. 

### Attack-Targeting
There are two types of attack targeting methods: **Single-target** and **area of effect** (**aoe**).

The different **attack-types** can be abbreviated as follows:

* **ST** stands for [single-target attack](#single-target-attack)
* **MST** stands for *multiple* [single-target attacks](#single-target-attack)
* **AOE** stands for [area of effect attack](#area-of-effect-attack)

#### Single-Target Attack
Any **single-target** attack can be dodged or defended against. To do so, an [opposed test](#opposed-test) is made. If the defender wins no damage is dealt. 

Against melee attacks, the defender must test their [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi). 

Against ranged attacks, the defender must test their [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi).

#### Area of Effect Attack
**Area of Effect** (**aoe**) attacks can only be dodged or defended against under certain conditions. 

If the **aoe** attack is magical and would affect a mage, that defending mage can choose to use their skill [counter-magic](#counter-magic), to try and counter the attack. If they choose to counter the spell, an [opposed test](#opposed-test) must be made. If the defender wins no damage is dealt. 

The defending mage incurs the same stamina cost as the attacker, when they cast the spell. However, every degree of success of the defender reduces their [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost by one. 

> A mage casts [pyromancy](#pyromancy) at another, at intensity level 6. That incurs the attacker a [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost of 6. 
> 
> The defender chooses to use their [counter-magic](#counter-magic). Now, an opposed test must be made. 
> 
> The attacker has an [arcana](#arcana-arc) of 5 and [pyromancy](#pyromancy) skill level of 6. They get to roll **8D6**. 
> 
> The defender has an [arcana](#arcana-arc) of 4 and [counter-magic](#counter-magic) skill of 5. They get to roll **7D6**. 
> 
> The defender achieves 4 **positives**, whereas the attacker only achieves 3 **positives**. That means, that the attack spell fails. The degree of success is 1, which reduces the [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost of the defender by 1. Thus, they incur a [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost of 5.  

It is only possible to use [counter-magic](#counter-magic), if the defender has at least one [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) left. 

If the **aoe** attack is of a non-magical nature, it may only be possible to dodge or defend against, if the **GM** allows for it. 

> A thrown bomb may perhaps be caught and thrown back at the attacker. But a cannon shot cannot be warded off. 

If there is no way to reasonably dodge or defend against the **aoe** attack, its damage is rolled right away. 

### Special Types of Attack
Sometimes, simply *hitting it* isn't enough. Sometimes, more control is needed. These rules outline how a character can do more specific attacks. 

#### Aimed Attack
An attack generally targets the center of mass (torso) of the targeted opponent. 

It is, however, possible to call out wanting to attack a specific part of an opponent's body. Generally, this means that the attack must be rolled at greater **Ob**. However, the **GM** can also decide the part being targeted is fairly easy to hit, either generally or due to current circumstance, so no disadvantage is incurred. 

A player may call out what effect the aimed attack is supposed to have, such as limiting their opponent's ability to stand, move, attack or whatever else the body part may be useful for. If they don't, the **GM** decides the effect. 

#### Difficult Attack
There may be attacks that are more difficult to perform, due to current circumstance. Such attack rolls are penalized with a higher **Ob**. 

An example for a *difficult attack* would be targeting an opponent with a ranged weapon when the opponent is behind cover. 

Another example would be attacking backwards, at an invisible target or with a broken arm, and so on.

#### Easy Attack
Some attacks may be easier to perform. An **easy attack** has a lower **Ob**.

The following are generally considered easy attacks (but at the **GM**'s discretion):
* From behind
* Against prone opponents
* Against restrained opponents

#### Execution Attack
The extreme version of an easy attack, the **execution attack** allows outright killing or maiming an opponent, without having to roll for an attack or for damage. 

Such an attack can be carried out against any character who is unable to resist (with the exception of player characters, see [death's door](#deaths-door)). 

> An unconscious character, or one chained to the wall couldn't possibly resist and can be instantaneously killed with an **execution attack**. 

This kind of attack is only possible at the **GM**'s discretion. 

## Dealing Damage
Damage dealt to an opponent reduces their **HP**. When their **HP** reaches 0, they suffer an [injury](#injury). 

If more damage is dealt, than the difference to 0, that damage is also dealt. Damage isn't lost - it overflows into the next **HP** *segment*. 

What type of [injury](#injury) is dealt, also depends on the [damage type](#damage-types). 

# Magic
Any character with [arcana](#arcana-arc), can cast magic. What kind of magic, depends on the [magic schools](#magic-schools) the character knows. 

While not all magic can be used offensively, that which can, will inflict [damage](#health--exhaustion), proportional to the [spell's intensity](#spell-intensity) and may cause other effects on those affected by it. 

The effects magic do not affect the mage casting, unless if they suffer a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire) or if it is an [aoe](#area-of-effect-attack) spell. 

## Magic Stamina
Magic takes a toll on the caster's body. It takes great mental effort to properly cast magic. **Magic stamina** represents a mage's capacity for casting magic without risk to themselves. 

Note that it is possible for a mage to cast magic that costs more **magic stamina** than they have available. Any magic cast that costs more **magic stamina** than is available, can cause a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire). 

**Magic stamina** is reduced every time magic is cast. The threshold is reduced by the [intensity](#spell-intensity) at which the spell was cast. Success or failure doesn't matter - even just the attempt to cast the spell incurs the **magic stamina** cost. 

Mechanically speaking, every mage has two values to track: their **maximum magic stamina** and their **current magic stamina**. The *threshold* is considered the maximum, while the current magic stamina must be tracked, separately. 

For every point past the current threshold that the magic casting costs, one **D6** must be rolled. If a 1 or a 2 is rolled, the spell [spell-backfires](#spell-backfire), dealing its full damage to the caster, instead. 

How much **magic stamina** a mage has available to them, is derived from their [arcana](#arcana-arc) attribute + the total level of all their known [magic school](#magic-school--school---attribute-) skill levels, divided by two and rounded up. 

> If a mage has an **arcana** of 3 and has the **magic school skills** **pyromancy** at level 3, **cryomancy** at level 2 and **counter-magic** at level 5, that means they have (3 + 3 + 2 + 5) / 2 = 7 **magic stamina**. 

### Recovery
Once spent, **magic stamina** can only be regained through **active rest or meditation**. For every 10 minutes spent in *active rest or meditation*, a mage regains 1 **magic stamina**. 

This implies not engaging in any physical or mental strains. 

## Spell Intensity
Any magic can be cast at different **intensities**. A greater **spell intensity** results in a greater effect, at a proportionally greater [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost. 

### Maximum Spell Intensity
A mage can only cast spells at an intensity up to a certain limit, called their **maximum spell intensity**. This number directly correlates to their skill in the type of [magic school](#magic-schools) they wish to use. 

This means, for every [school of magic](#magic-schools) the mage knows, they may have a different **maximum spell intensity**. 

## Spell-Backfire
A spell-backfire causes a spell to affect the caster, instead of their intended target. 

In case of an [aoe](#area-of-effect-attack) attack spell, anything nearby the mage, in range, also receives the damage, unless if it can [counter-magic](#counter-magic) it.

The mage suffers the full damage and/or effect of the spell. If anything or anyone nearby is affected, they also suffer the full damage and/or effect of the spell. 

A **spell-backfire** can occur, if a mage is casting a spell that costs more [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) than they have left, or if they **completely fail** their test to cast the spell. 

## Magic Things
**Ambersteel** takes its name from the in-game material of the same name. As it is a strictly anti-magic material, it should enjoy great attention in any fantasy world, where magic is a real and recognizable force. Where usually, magic is the centerpiece, in **Ambersteel** that isn't quite the case. Magic is powerful and fearsome and thus, if not under control, can threaten to cause great pain and destruction. **Ambersteel** dampens that power and puts shackles on it. 

But there are also other materials and important things related to magic, as described in this section. 

### Abyssalite
**Abyssalite** is a hard and brittle mineral, that has the ability to *amplify the flow of magic*. It can only be acquired from the depths of the earth and is fairly rare. 

Its surface is unnaturally smooth and covered in a fine, iridescent shine. Underneath the smooth surface, one searches for depth and color in vain. It is as though the void itself is being contained by that iridescent shell. 

**Abyssalite** is a hard and brittle mineral, prone to shattering if too much force is applied. This makes it difficult to shape. It is also fairly heavy, which makes it difficult to carry long. 

A fist-sized **Abyssalite** chunk has a [bulk](#carrying-capacity) of 2 and grants one greater [spell intensity](#spell-intensity), but without costing any [exhaustion](#exhaustion). In order to use the **Abyssalite**, the caster must be touching it. 

### Amberite
As magic is amplified by [Abyssalite](#abyssalite), its antithesis is called **Amberite**, a metal which dulls the effects of magic and slows any magic flow nearby it. The material is also known to affect magic creatures and can cause great pain in magic-users. 

Weapons made from **Amberite** are quite popular with witch and monster hunters alike, although fairly hard to come by, due to the difficulty in **Amberite** processing. 

**Amberite** is a crystalline material, that can be molten down and shaped, like iron. It glows weakly, in the fiery orange of the name-sharing amber stone. Near the edges, the glow fades to a dull reflection, like cooling molten glass. 

It only occurs naturally in a few select places in the world, where the ground offers the right conditions. **Amberite** grows over time, in the right environment. It can take several decades for a finger-sized crystal to grow to the size of an adult man's forearm. Attempts to cultivate it have mostly failed, as **Amberite** farmers have so far been unable to understand and reproduce the right conditions for it to thrive. Due to the slow rate at which it grows, an **Amberite** farmer may not realize the lack of growth until well into a decade later. 

Prolonged exposure to **Amberite** can cause severe ill-effects with nausea and migranes being common symptoms. 

### Ambersteel
[Amberite](#amberite) can be processed into **Ambersteel**, which makes it a hard and flexible metal. The raw material heats slowly and must be heated over the course of several days and nights, without interruption. When it finally reaches the right temperature, it will glow white, with a purple sheen. At that point, it can be hammered into shape. Constant re-heating ensures it stays at the right temperature and a final quenching in vegetable oil ensures it retains its flexibility. 

If processed outside the optimal temperature, the material quickly grows brittle and will shatter if any stress is put on it.

Due to the length of the process and the difficulty in keeping the right temperature, smiths capable of creating **Ambersteel** are rare. 

### Runes
Shards of [Abyssalite](#abyssalite) can have runes carved into them, which allow magic to flow through the runes. This renders runes extremely powerful artifacts, as they can allow for near limitless magic-use, even in the hands of a non-mage. 

To activate such a rune, is a difficult skill to learn, however. Even if no innate magical ability is required, an understanding of the flow of magic is. The rune must be touched in the right spots, at the right intervals, to activate successfully. Mistakes in this procedure can have disastrous results. 

What's more, it takes great skill to carve the right runes, as each rune's shape and complexity depends in part on the size and shape of the [Abyssalite](abyssalite) shard. The only way to get it right, is to *feel* the way the rune must be shaped. Alternatively, the shard can be adjusted to be of equivalent size and shape, but this requires considerable effort, as [Abyssalite](abyssalite) is a brittle material, prone to shattering if too much force is applied. 

In order to craft a **rune**:
* A **rune** can only be made to cast one type of magic. So the carver has to pick one of the [magic schools](#magic-schools). 
* The maximum **level** at which a **rune** can be created, depends on the carver's skill. The **level** of the **rune** dictates the [spell intensity](#spell-intensity) it will cast its spell at. 
* The carver has to succeed a [rune carving](#rune-carving-arc) skill test. 
  * If they fail, the carving is botched and the [Abyssalite chunk](#abyssalite) cannot be used for another carving attempt. There is no room for mistakes. 

In order to invoke a **rune**:
* A **complete success** of a [rune-using](#rune-using-agi) skill test will invoke the spell of the **rune** as expected.
* A **partial success** or **complete failure** results in a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire). 

# Appendix
The appendix contains important and less important lists, for reference only when needed. 

## Skill List
The following list does not and cannot aim to be a complete listing of all possible skills in game. Adding new skills as necessary will have to be done by the **GM**. 

Some skills have a list of **skill abilities** that a character unlocks, if they reach a certain level in that skill. A **skill ability** has one or more effects and one or more conditions that restrict when they're applicable. 

Using a **skill ability** counts as an **action**. 

For a human, a skill at level 10 represents absolute mastery. It is possible to go higher than that, but only with great effort. The average level a human could reasonably have in a skill they've been practicing for months, should be around 3 or 4. Only years of experience allow for a 5 or higher. Anything higher than 5 should be considered excellence. 

### Physical skills

### Cryomancy [Arc]
The summoning and control of ice. Cryomancer's can inflict [frostbite](#frostbite) on opponents. They can also freeze things, so they're harder to break. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance | Type | Damage | Effect(s)                      |

| 1     | Freezing Touch       | 2  | 0 | ST | **1 Freezing** | A fist-sized spot on whatever the mage's hand touches, freezes over. This is only a surface-level freeze! It does not run deep. |
| 3     | Cold Finger Gun      | 2  | 15'/5m | ST | **1D4 Freezing** | The mage shoots a finger-sized ice spike from their hand. Anyone hit, will incur 1 point of [frostbite](#frostbite). |

Or wait, until the ice thaws... |

### Restoration [Emp]
The mending of injuries and treatment of diseases. 

**Life leech** can be opposed by [resist](#resist-will). 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance | Type | Damage | Effect(s)                      |
| ----- | -------------------- | -- | -------- | ---- | ------ | ------------------------------ |

### Alteration [Int]
The alteration of physical things, to change their shape and purpose, permanently. 

Note that altering the shape of creatures poses a particular challenge. Unless if the test is a **complete success**, the target creature may mutate, horribly. When failing a test, consult the [list of mutations](#list-of-mutations), to determine the type of mutation. 

Creatures can [resist](#resist-will) the change. Inanimate objects don't resist. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance | Type | Damage | Effect(s)                      |
| ----- | -------------------- | -- | -------- | ---- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| 0+    | Alter Shape          | 3  | 18'/6m   | ST   | 0      | Resist: **Ob N**, Effect: The object or creature is altered as the mage desires. |

### Illusion [Emp]
Creation of non-physical influences on the senses. That includes images, sounds and odors. The illusions cannot cause direct harm, although they can drive an individual to acts that may put them in danger. 

The mage can always choose to **either** create an image **or** a sound **or** an odor. How long these illusions last, is determined by the [spell's intensity](#spell-intensity). All of these illusions only apply to those individuals, who are within the given *distance* to the mage and who **fail** a [resist](#resist-will) test, at the given **Ob**. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance | Type | Damage | Effect(s)                      |
| ----- | -------------------- | -- | -------- | ---- | ------ | ------------------------------ |

| 5     | Bewitching Illusion  | 4  | 96'/32m  | MST  | 0      | Resist: **Ob 5**, Duration: entire combat / 1 hour, Effect: up to 36'³/12m³ sized image / a deafening sound / an overwhelming odor; A resist test can be made again every 10 minutes |
| 7     | Living a Dream       | 4  | 192'/64m | MST  | 0      | Resist: **Ob 7**, Duration: however long the mage desires, Effect: however large the mage desires image / a deafening sound / an overwhelming odor; A resist test can be made again every hour |

### Soul-Binding [Int]
Also referred to as **necromancy**, this is the art and skill of calling souls from the **plane of the dead** and binding them, to reanimate corpses or animate an otherwise unliving body. 

In order to bind a soul, a **soul-seal** is required. This seal has to take the form of a pentagram. The medium doesn't matter, although if the seal is destroyed, the soul binding is broken. So, if a mage wants to create a lasting soul-binding, an enduring medium for the seal is advisable. 

A mage can only ever issue commands to a soul that they've bound. It is not possible to command souls bound by other mages. 

A **soul-binding** can be broken, but it in order to do so, a **soul-binding** test at **Ob** equal to the strength of the **soul-binding** must be **completely succeeded**. It is possible to lift a **soul-binding** made by another mage. 

An important note about **completely failing** a **soul-binding** attempt - a **complete failure** results in the spell-backfiring and displacing the mage's soul with the one they were trying to bind. Their soul is essentially evicted from their own body and sent to the **plane of the dead**. The soul they tried to bind then takes over their body. 

Another important note about targeting a specific soul. It is easier to recall the soul that previously inhabited a body, the shorter the time of death has been. However, targeting a specific soul is an immensely difficult undertaking and shouldn't be taken lightly. For every hour past the original time of death, the difficulty of recalling the soul increases by **1 Ob**. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance  | Type | Damage | Effect(s)                      |
| ----- | -------------------- | -- | --------- | ---- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1+    | Call and Bind a Soul | 3  | 0         | ST   | 0      | Create a **soul-binding** at the strength of the chosen level. The larger, heavier and more complex a body is, the harder it is to create a binding. Anything larger than, heavier or more complex than a human will make the **soul-binding** harder. Requires a **soul-seal**. Replacing an existing binding is only possible, if the prior **soul-binding** is first broken.  |
| 1+    | Command Bound Soul   | 1  | N * 6'/3m | ST   | 0      | Resist: **Ob 6-N**, Effect: Issue a single command that the bound soul **must** follow. |
| 1+    | Break Binding        | 3  | 0         | ST   | 0      | Resist: *strength of the binding*, Effect: Break a **soul-binding** and send the soul back to the **plane of the dead**, leaving its former body inanimate and soulless. |
| 5+    | Call back a Soul     | 3  | 0         | ST   | 0      | Difficulty: **Ob 12-N** Target a specific soul and recall them into their prior body. This isn't, strictly speaking, the same as binding a soul. |

### Telekinesis [Int]
The ability to affect things and even creatures from afar, using magic winds instead of muscles or tools. 

The mage can only affect things within and up to the given *distance*. 

When using objects as projectiles, choose the [damage type](#damage-types) as appropriate. For example, a crossbow bolt might cause **piercing** damage, while a rock might cause **crushing** damage.

Note, that moving creatures (even undead ones or actually dead ones) is not the same as moving soulless objects. It takes great skill to affect creatures directly. Starting from level 7, creatures can be affected directly, by the mage. The mage can only affect those creatures that either don't resist, or which **fail** a [resist](#resist-will) test, at the given **Ob**. 

The mage can only ever perform *one* movement with a spell cast. So, for example, it is not possible to violently shake things or creatures around, without casting **telekinesis** multiple times, to do so. During combat, every movement takes one turn. Out of combat, about five seconds. A single movement is a displacement from one point to another, in a straight and uninterrupted line. 

In the following, replace *N* with the chosen level above 10. 

| Level | Name                   | AP | Distance     | Type | Damage   | Effect(s)                      |
| ----- | ---------------------- | -- | ------------ | ---- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1     | Telekinesis 1          | 2  | N * 9'/3m    | ST   | /        | Move a light object. It can only be moved slowly, not allowing its use as a projectile. |
| 2+    | Telekinesis 2          | 2  | N * 12'/4m   | ST   | **(N-1)D4** **Bludgeoning** | Move a light object at great velocity, which allows it to deal damage upon impact.  |
| 3     | Heavy Telekinesis 1    | 3  | N * 18'/6m   | ST   | /        | Move a heavy object. It can only be moved slowly, not allowing its use as a projectile. |
| 4+    | Heavy Telekinesis 2    | 3  | N * 24'/8m   | ST   | **(N-2)D6** **Bludgeoning** | Move a heavy object at great velocity, which allows it to deal damage upon impact.  |
| 7     | Creature Telekinesis 1 | 4  | 24'/8m       | ST   | /        | Resist: **Ob 3**, Effect: Move a single creature that is about man-sized, or smaller. |
| 8     | Creature Telekinesis 2 | 4  | 30'/10m      | ST   | /        | Resist: **Ob 5**, Effect: Move a single creature that is about twice the size of a man, or smaller. |
| 10+   | Creature Telekinesis 3 | 4  | N * 3'/1m    | ST   | /        | Resist: **Ob N-3**, Effect: Move a single large creature, or smaller. |

### Telepathy [Ora]
The ability to communicate wordlessly, to alter emotions and even issue compelling commands against another's will. 

The mage can only affect those creatures that either don't resist, or which **fail** a [resist](#resist-will) test, at the given **Ob**. 

In the following, replace *N* with the appropriate level. 

| Level | Name                   | AP | Distance   | Type | Damage | Effect(s)                      |
| ----- | ---------------------- | -- | ---------- | ---- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1+    | Wordless Communication | 2  | N * 12'/4m | MST  | /      | Resist: **Ob N**, Effect: Communicate wordlessly with *N* number of creatures. |
| 3+    | Change a Mind          | 2  | N * 12'/4m | ST   | /      | Resist: **Ob N**, Effect: Alter a creature's current state of mind and emotion. |
| 4     | Pressing Thought       | 3  | 36'/18m    | ST   | /      | Effect: [Hasten](#hasted) a creature of choice for two turns of combat or 10 seconds out of combat. |
| 6     | Quiet Command          | 3  | N * 12'/4m | ST   | /      | Resist: **Ob N-2**, Effect: Issue a command to another creature, which they feel strongly compelled to follow. |

### Counter-Magic [End]
The redirection and dissolution of magic flow. This is the skill to use to defend against magic attacks. 

Being a purely defensive skill, **counter-magic** only provides the benefit of easier defense at the higher levels. 

This skill can only be used, if the mage has at least one point of [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) left. 

However, knowing **counter-magic** at higher levels allows reducing incoming [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) costs. 

For every three levels in **counter-magic**, **1D3 - 1** can be rolled, to determine by how much the **magic stamina** cost is reduced. 

> At **counter-magic** level 6, you may roll **2D3 - 2**. At best, you can reduce the incoming **magic stamina** cost by 4, at worst, you can't reduce it, at all. 

Note that it is not possible to reduce [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost to less than 1.

## Shield Types
Shields are items that provide passive bonuses to [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) and [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi) and require one free hand to use. This implies they cannot be used at the same time as a two-handed weapon. 

### Buckler
A small, round shield commonly held as far from the body as possible, to deflect small or stabbing weapons with ease. Helps only little against heavy blows, however. And don't expect to deflect arrows with this, either. 

* Bulk: 1

| Defensive Bonus |
| --------------- |
| +1 [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi).  |
| +3 [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) against **stabbing** attacks. |

If lined with [Ambersteel](#ambersteel), also grants **+1** defence against magic. 

### Round Shield
A medium-sized, round shield made from tough wood and leather, which offers decent protection against most attacks, while not encumbering the wielder too much. 

* Bulk: 2

| Defensive Bonus |
| --------------- |
| +2 [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi).  |
| +2 [ranged defence](#melee-defence-agi). |

| Defensive Bonus |
| --------------- |
| +3 [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi).  |
| +3 [ranged defence](#melee-defence-agi). |

If lined with [Ambersteel](#ambersteel), also grants **+2** defence against magic. 

### Kite Shield
A large, kite-shaped shield, which can protect every part of the fighter, from the shoulder down to the feet. Its weight makes it difficult to react to attacks quickly, hoever. 

* Bulk: 4
* +1 [exhaustion](#exhaustion) while wielded

| Defensive Bonus |
| --------------- |
| +4 [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi).  |

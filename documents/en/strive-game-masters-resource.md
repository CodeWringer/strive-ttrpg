# Introduction
This document is directed at (and somewhat reserved for) the Game Master (**GM**) - the one person at the table who everyone agrees has the **authority** and **burden** to run the game. It will outline all the must-knows and present ideas on how to run the game. While most of the information is hopefully useful, keep in mind these are not hard rules, but rather well-intentioned advice.

A role-playing game by Nicolas H.

# The Role Of a Game Master
As the **GM**, you are the one person at the table playing a slightly different game than the others. Instead of controlling a single character in a given world, you are in control of the world itself and determine what the characters within it get to do. 

You're the host of the game. This means you'll have to organize everything. Invite players or make a post detailling the game you want to host, set the time and place and interview players who show interest. 

You prepare maps, NPCs, stories and plot hooks. You involve the PCs in the world, offer them incentives to act and feed their [Drivers](./strive-core.md#personality). 

You moderate and mediate. When there is conflict between players, you help with reconciliation. You ensure every player gets a chance to speak and ensure players are comfortable being at your table. Ask for and hear their feedback. Criticism is a chance to improve. 

Players may help with all of these tasks, but that may not be commonplace. These are foremost *your* tasks and are much the reason why running the game can be a challenge, but also great fun. It is a very demanding, but also very rewarding process. 

It is *your world* and *your game*, but the other people at the table are *your players*. Find the right players for your game and *make* your game *right* for your players. They are your guests and will only stay for as long as they feel welcome. 

## Getting a Game Together
Before inviting or interviewing your first player, you'll have to define a few parameters. 
* What theme and setting will the game have? A grimdark campaign of desperate survival? A heroic war against evil gods? A Cthulean horror mystery? An epic space opera in a galaxy full of conflict? Or something else entirely? 
  * Will you be following a pre-defined narrative (e. g. an adventure book) or throw the PCs in a sandbox and let them go wherever they will? 
* How may sessions will you host? A one-shot, two-shot or other number? Perhaps you don't want to place a limit and simply keep running the game for as long as it remains fun. 
* If the game is online, do you expect everyone to be using webcams or do you make that optional?
* Are there any taboo subjects that you will dodge during play and expect your players to avoid? Torture, racism, sexism and such? Your players should get a say in this, too.
* Do you expect people at the table to always act in-character? Do you expect players to speak as their character would? Or do you see such behavior as entirely optional? Forcing it may make players uncomfortable very quickly, so be careful with this one. 

After having determined these parameters, classically comes the so-called session zero. This is the first time you and your players get together for the game, but you won't be playing yet. 

In a running game, when inviting additional players, always make sure to involve the players already in your group in the interview and decision-making process. After all, they'll be interacting with any newcomers as much as you. 

## Your Game
There is an *unspoken social contract* between you, the **GM** and your players. Everyone at the table agrees that you *get to call the shots*. You present every scenario and its challenges, you arbitrate and moderate and you narrate and listen. 

When presenting challenges and obstacles to the PCs, keep in mind it is **not** your job to think of possible solutions. *That*, is the *players' job*. It is also not your job to come up with PC reactions, emotions, thoughts or goals. That is also the players' job and furthermore, *their* prerogative. This point is further explained in [Player Agency](#player-agency). 

The rules are in your hands. If you find one of **STRIVE**'s rules not to be agreeable, you may change it, so that it fits your game. This is called *house-ruling* - introducing unofficial rules that are only in effect at your table. In fact, you're hereby strongly encouraged to modify and add to the rules, as you see fit. Especially the list of skills is non-exhaustive, meaning, there is a very high chance one of your players will eventually want their character to do something, for which there isn't a skill defined, yet. You can even allow your players to invent skills. That way, not *all* of the work lies on you, but be mindful that you'll have to ensure the skills *make sense* and don't result in a character *suddenly* becoming an invulnerable power-house. 

With the **authority** to *make decisions*, also comes a certain **responsibility**. It is your task to entertain your players. Not like a comedian or a singer, but something more subtle and complex than that. You agree to keep your players **interested and engaged** in your game. You agree to weave their characters into stories of which *even you* may have no idea how they'll play out. In your rulings, you must **be fair and consistent**. No player is favored. They're **all** your friends and guests. Abuse your authority, and players will eventually leave your table. 

You agree to **mediate and moderate**. Should players fight, in-person, out-of-character, then there may be a time when you, as the one running the game have to step in and find a resolution. Either you can find a way for them to reconcile, or someone may have to leave the game. When players keep talking over each other, it is your responsibility to moderate. Have them take turns when speaking. Make sure everyone who has something to say, gets to. 

Even if all of these and the following points may sound very dogmatic, see them more as well-intentioned advice, than hard rules for you to follow. Find your style and develop it as you like. 

Of course, the specifics of the *unspoken social contract* can be different for you and your group. And perhaps the social contract doesn't *have* to remain unspoken. It might be a good idea to ensure everyone is on the same page, in regards to what is expected of **GM** and players. In session zero, when you first introduce the game you wish to run, you could bring up this social contract as a point on the agenda. 

## Your Players
The game can only happen, because of your players - the people *willing* to be at your table and engage with your game. Treat them with the same respect you expect from them and always consider this - they are offering you the most valuable commodity they have - their time. Of course, *your time* is just as valuable!

Understand how your players think and how they enjoy their table-top role-playing game experience. If they like combat and loathe interacting with NPCs, you can cater to that, by presenting them with lots of *interesting* combat scenarios. On the other hand, if they love to role-play, they'll probably enjoy meeting and interacting with varied and quirky NPCs. 

Figuring out how to get your players engaged in your game and noticing that engagement, can be a very rewarding sensation. It is a sign of a fun and worth-while experience and will cement their interest in your game! 

# Your World
STRIVE doesn't impose a world on you. You are not forced to play with any pre-defined theme or setting. This frees you up to play in whatever world you prefer, with whatever theme you prefer. But it also places the burden of such decisions on you. 

STRIVE's modules can help you answer the question of theme. For example, if you want to play in a medieval fantasy world, STRIVE's fantasy module may get you started faster. 

But setting - the world - is entirely up to you. You may choose an existing world from another RPG, or craft an entirely new one. Creating a world is no small feat and a hobby in itself, but luckily, you don't need the entire world to be perfectly fleshed out before you begin running the game. All you really need, is a rough idea of *what's where* and a detailed idea of where the PCs are *now*. Starting with a village in the woods and a nearby goblin lair, is a classic example. 

Your players may aid you in crafting the world and will usually prefer doing so during play, rather than outside of it. If you allow them to change your world through their actions, it becomes a much more dynamic and almost life-like beast. If they defend the village from the goblins and destroy their lair, the village might start to prosper. More trade might come in, and through the traders, the PCs might learn about other places they could visit and acquire more and better supplies.

## Non-Player Characters (NPCs)
Non-player characters (NPCs) are all the **people, animals and monsters** of your world, that aren't the player characters. NPCs are one of your most important tools to bring your world to life and make it interesting and engaging to your players. More often than not, the most interesting sessions involve heavy or mindful use of NPCs. 

There are three types of NPCs:
* **People**: These are sentient, sapient and civilized folk, who can be reasoned with and interacted with on the same level as the PCs. See them as you do real people. There are no rules or mechanics dictating how they should behave, but they are *expected* to engage with the PCs and to react to the PCs' actions. 
* **Animals**: Sentient, but not sapient, these are creatures driven by animalistic instinct. They are neither inherently evil, nor good, and mostly care only about their base needs. Think wolves, bears, dogs and the like. But this may also be fantastical creatures, such as dragons, gryphons, space-whales and so on. 
* **Monsters**: Possibly sentient and/or sapient, these creatures can be of natural or unnatural origin and are usually irredeemably evil and destructive. Examples might be demons from an abyssal plane of existence, undead, constructs, robots and such. These are natural antagonists of the PCs and their origin cultures. 

There is a distinction to be made between "proper" NPCs and "simple" NPCs:
* A "proper" NPC has a fully filled out character sheet, with distinct values for each Attribute and every Skill. These are **main actors** in the story that aren't PCs. They will be the **key figures** that hand out quests, help or hinder the PCs' progress and possibly follow agendas of their own. 
* A "simple" NPC is only a **passing acquaintance**, an animal or a faceless enemy in a conflict. They serve as temporary obstacles or "padding" in a scene, to give it liveliness without the bureaucratic overhead of a whole character sheet. 

You may begin introducing most NPCs as simple and flesh out their character sheets only as necessary. Sometimes, you may be surprised which NPCs the players take interst in, almost forcing you to flesh out what you expected to be only a passing acquaintance. 

To keep this chapter brief, and because you might decide you don't need it, the mechanical process of creating NPCs is detailed in a later chapter, the [NPC-Builder](#npc-builder). 

### Bring NPCs To Life
Much like the PCs, or in fact real people, *proper* NPCs lead their own lives, with their own ambitions, aspirations, reactions, strengths and weaknesses. Keeping track of all of the numbers that implies, can become quite the challenge. But you won't need all of that data from the start, or even to track it all the time. Flesh out and update only as needed, to keep the work-load on your end low. You have enough work on your plate, as it is.

Whenever the PCs encounter someone new, all you really need, is a **rough idea** of *who* that NPC *is* and how you *expect* them to interact with the PCs. You don't have to know all their history right away, nor all of their strengths, weaknesses or even their agenda. Invent those as needed. 

And *who* an NPC is, depends on several factors, such as:
* their social status (e. g. a noble vs. a peasant)
* their cultural background
* their physique
* their occupation (e. g. a carpenter vs. a professional soldier)
* their financial status
* what you *think* their agenda *should be*, based on the above

While putting on an accent and visibly acting out the quirks of an NPC certainly helps in bringing them to life, what's more important is how they interact with the PCs. Are they supportive of the PCs? Do they offer a warm meal whenever they see the PCs or do they bar their door and close the window curtains? Do they stand up defiantly or cower meekly? In fact, even something as simple as ignoring the PCs can say a lot about what the NPC thinks about them. 

More often than not, you'll have NPCs be the source of quests and adventures for the PCs. But you can also have some NPCs that work for the PCs. This, especially, gives players a greater sense of agency in your world. It allows them to "move pieces on the board", to enact schemes and have some passive interaction happening, in the background. These retainer NPCs can be used to great effect, to drive PCs to action, or feed them information which they may then choose to act on.

You also get to use NPCs as a tool to feed players information or false rumors. Be careful how you approach rumors and lies. Players have a tendency to assume everything the **GM** says is true. So when an NPC feeds them false information, they tend not to question it. Before you can effectively use false information as a tool, you'll have to establish that NPCs will not always speak the truth. Perhaps by introducing an NPC, who will tell the most outrageous, but obvious, lies. Maybe even about the PCs. That would certainly make your players sceptical. The specifics of this are entirely up to you and your specific game, of course. 

## First Impressions Are Definitive
Whenever you introduce a new aspect of your world, that introduction will stick. In whatever way you portray an aspect of your world, *that*, is how players will remember it. A first impression tends to teach us **fundamental expectations**. 

For this reason, it is often wise to introduce **normality first**, instead of the exception. If you have the PCs get robbed the first time they enter a city, they'll henceforth expect to be robbed *every* time they enter a city. Especially when faced with hostile experiences, the first time PCs interact with a new aspect of the world, that aspect will seem more hostile in general. Combine many such experiences, and you end up with a world that seems extremely hostile. Unless if you're playing a grimdark campaign, you should be wary of arriving at such a state. 

If it is normal to arrive in a new city safely, find secure lodgings, go to the market or inn and *not* be robbed or molested, then that should be the first impression the PCs get to experience. Unless, of course, there is solid narrative reason why that shouldn't be the case. Even so, it *will* paint a picture the players won't soon forget. 

This is also why PCs should be expected to behave as their origin cultures dictate. This point is probably up for contention, as PCs are usually somewhat special. They may deviate to an extent, but even so, the "elf in the party" defines the very perception of elves to all the players. The way that PC behaves, is the way players will expect all elves to behave, because that is often their first exposure to people of that culture (and yes, elves most certainly also have various differing cultures, which further complicates the issue). However, this is not to say you should step in whenever the PC "misbehaves" and prevent their action outright. After all, *you* do not decide the PC's actions. Their player does. But you may offer counsel and inform them that their PC probably *knows* they're currently acting atypical. And perhaps the player just doesn't enjoy the cultural background of their PC. If so, you may want to let them change it. There is little point in forcing a player to play a PC they don't enjoy playing. 

# Running The Game
While the previous sections provide an overview of the expectations of a **GM**, this sections aims to help you fulfill those expectations. 

## Starting the Session
There are a few steps to take before diving right back into the action. 

### Recap The Last Session
A good start for every session is asking one of your players (volunteers first) to outline what their characters did and experienced in the last session. This refreshes everyone's memory on what they did and should be doing. It also encourages them to take notes during play. 

It is important you only correct them on *crucial* plot points, which they really should get right. Keep in mind that players tend to see the **GM**'s word as **absolute truth**. This is why, when you re-tell the events and those differ from what the players remember, it *might* alienate them from the world and the story. They thought they understood what was going on, but then you correct them and prove they were wrong all along - that can be frustrating. 

In fact, you may even correct some of the details of how events *actually* played out, based on what your players re-tell. This is best done silently. No need to encourage *meta-gaming*, which has your players intentionally recapping the last session incorrectly, in a way to make you change details in their characters' favor. 

### Personality & Driver Adjustments
After a recap of the last session, players should have a basis from which to work new [drivers](./strive-core.md#personality) into their character and to shift [personality traits](./strive-core.md#personality-traits). Allow them a few minutes to think and discuss. 

Once everyone has their characters figured out, have everyone, one by one, read **drivers** and personality changes out aloud. There are two reasons to do this:
1. The other players can know, if an aspiration targets their character. So if a PC (player) starts acting odd towards another player (their PC), that player knows it's part of the role-play and not directed towards them as a person. <br>
It also allows the player whose character is targeted by the aspiration to form ideas on how to react to it. This serves as [Fair Warning](#fair-warning). 
1. It familiarizes you with their **drivers**, which ***you have to know***, so that you may prepare scenarios that *challenge* or *feed* those drivers. It may be wise to take notes on their drivers - what the driver is and how you might challenge or feed it.

Be mindful that players knowing the **aspirations** of their fellow PCs should not be allowed to meta-game. 

> If a PC has an aspiration to the detriment of their fellow PC and this is a fresh aspiration, the targeted PC shouldn't *suddenly* become more suspicious towards their ally. At least not without sufficient reason. Of course, a PC can figure out another's intentions, but not by virtue of their owning *player* knowing. 

### Read Out Fate Point Purchases
Once **drivers** are handled, move on to what meta-powers players purchased with their [fate points](#fate-points). 

Especially since these are strictly meta-game powers, everyone should be clear on this. 

## During the Session
While running the session, you'll have the most work and the toughest job. Listen to your players attentively, react and prompt as needed. 

You'll have to keep a lot in mind. This section aims to provide a set of reminders. 

### Use The Senses
When you describe scenes, not just what one can see is of relevance. What are the PCs' other senses picking up? What about hearing? Smell? Do the mages sense the flow of magic? What's the temperature like? Is the air damp or dry? Is the ground trembling from a giant's heavy footfalls?

Try to pick only the most significant and most symbolic influences on the senses for your scene. There is little point in describing the gentle rustle of the wind in the leaves, whenever the PCs enter a forest. But if there is a strong stench of decay in the air, which wasn't there before, then that's probably noteworthy. 

More often than not, PCs would be on the look-out for anything out of the ordinary in a given scene. So anything *obvious* to the PCs, anything that *should* stand out to them, you should describe unprompted. 

Of course, sometimes, describing a peaceful and soothing scene can be a welcome and effective change. After a harrowing fight, the PCs might enter a safe area, where you describe it as a peaceful meadow, serene village or anything along those lines. In that case, the gentle rustle of leaves in the wind may actually be a welcome reprieve. 

### The Tools
This section outlines the tools - methods - of engaging your players. Usually, that means challenging their characters, sometimes even the players themselves - to think creatively. 

**Mechanical challenges** are your *game-y* tools to engage your players. Dice are usually involved. Injuries and illnesses, combat and asset management belong to this category. 

**Narrative challenges** are your *role-playing* tools to engage your players. They utilize the strength of the medium. You can resolve all narrative challenges through role-playing. Dice may not be needed, at all. 

#### Combat Challenges
Challenging PCs through combat encounters is most fun to players who enjoy strategic and tactical thinking. 

**STRIVE** expects combat to be occasional, with ample breaks in-between. The game isn't well suited to prolonged dungeon-crawls. Injuries put a character out of commission for a good while. For this reason, you should always plan to provide a means of escape and retreat for the PCs. 

To make combat encounters challenging, you may play around with the number of opponents, as well as their capabilities. 

Present the close-quarters warrior PC with an opponent who's out of reach. Have the blood-letting fanatic PC deal with a foe that can't bleed. Present the mage PC with an opponent clad in magic resistant material. But always keep in mind one thing - the foes your players engage should always have weaknesses which the PCs can discover. And ideally, one party member should be able to help another. 

> The player party's mage is ambushed by an anti-mage fanatic. The mage shoots fire at their assailant, but finds the fire dissipate into nothing more than hot smoke right before the fanatic's eyes. But the mage's ally, a halberd-wielding ex-footsoldier jumps in and lands a devastating blow, severly injuring the fanatic. 
> 
> The wounded fanatic cannot fight on and attempts to flee. The PCs can now attempt to attack the fleeing fanatic with conventional means, or let them go. The mage alone might not have had such an easy time of it. But thanks to their ally, they didn't have to fear that foe. 

Fights should be winnable - unless you make it **very** clear to the players their characters can **not** win a particular fight. They should be given the option to retreat or circumvent such an encounter. 

Even more interesting fights can occur, if you involve the environment, as well. Introduce both hazards and tools for the PCs to be threatened by, or to exploit. These are just some examples of interactive combat environments: 
* An illegal gunpowder storage. Any careless use of fire could cause a cascade of explosions. Be mindful to not straight-up wipe out the PCs if the gunpowder does get set on fire. They should be harmed, but give them a chance to recover or flee from that blunder. It may even be possible to draw out the explosions. One explosion every turn, putting time pressure on the PCs to get out and also give them the time to do so. 
* A giant cave, full of giant spider webs. If anyone should be unfortunate enough to stumble or be knocked into a web, a giant spider descends from the shadowy corners of the ceiling and begins to threaten that character, specifically. If that happens to be a PC, their allies have to think quick, to get them free, but also keep their original opponents on their toes. On the other hand, the PCs can attempt to knock their foes into the webs. 
* A burning house, with the PCs and their opponents in the thick of it. At the start of every turn, a burning piece of debris falls from the ceiling and you randomly determine where it lands. Could be on a PC, could be on one of their opponents. Or it could be in front of and barring their only exit - an open window leading to safety. 
* A rickety, old bridge, which could collapse if too much force was applied to its support beams. The PCs could exploit this to collapse the bridge on purpose. Or their opponents could attempt the same, to put time-pressure on the players. 

#### Social Challenges
Outside of combat, you can challenge your PCs' with social encounters, opportunities to exercise their skills and pursue their **drivers**. 

Present opportunities for the PCs to learn new things. Present them with tests for skills they don't have. But do so sparingly. It is frustrating for a player to never get to play to their character's strengths. Give players that satisfaction of having *the right skill at the right time*. 

When it comes to skill tests, it is prudent to be wary of *test band-wagon'ing*. When you ask a specific player (or rather, their character) to do a test in a certain skill or attribute and if they fail, another player jumps in and asks, if they can try, consider well how you answer. <br>
If you allow it, you make the player you first asked feel less special and important. After all, you must have had a good reason why *only their character* could do the test, to begin with. If you found that only that one PC had a chance at even attempting the test, you shouldn't allow other PCs to make the test. 

> A classic example is asking one of your players to test their character's observation. They fail and the other players immediately ask if they can try, as well. If they could, you shouldn't have asked just the one player, but instead asked all of them to begin with. 
> 
> But if you think only the one character could have succeeded that test, you shouldn't allow the others to try. 

On the other hand, you should only have such specifically targeted tests, if failure doesn't result in a dead-end for the PCs. Try to aim more towards tests that can result in the players being informed of a potential challenge ahead of time. 

> For example, a sneaky PC might have successfully infiltrated a palace, where they aim to gather intelligence on their political enemies. The **GM** asks them to do a observation test, which they succeed. As a result, the **GM** informs the player, that their character overhears voices from a room next door. 
> 
> The PC walks up to the door leading to the other room, and eavedrops. They overhear two men talking about increased patrols and sightings of an intruder. The player decides, based on that information, to leave the palace early, as things are getting too risky for them to stay. 
> 
> Had the PC failed their test, the **GM** would have told them to move on. Perhaps even given them a different piece of information, like hearing noises outside the room they're in, but without a clear direction. The player might not think much of it, and decide to stay. That's when the guards walk in and surprise the PC. They can still make their get-away, albeit involving more running in blind panic, than sneaking calmly. 

#### Driver Challenges
You can both *feed* and *challenge* PCs' **drivers**. Feeding a driver means giving a PC new information or assets that they may use to pursue the driver's goal. Challenging a driver means presenting the character with new information or opponents who contradict the goal - an obstacle to overcome. 

Make sure to regularly feed or challenge **each** PCs' **drivers**. This is important, as it keeps their players interested and attentive. It makes their goals matter and gives them purpose and *direction*, which prevents inactivity and boredom. 

> For example, a PC has an old enemy who they've vowed to take revenge on. While the final confrontation is still a ways away, every once in a while, that PC finds information regarding their enemy. You could feed that PC information on their enemy's current or recent whereabouts and activities. Not enough to give them a trail to follow, but enough to keep them aware and in pursuit of their long-term goal. 
> 
> Then, you present them with an opportunity to steal some asset from their enemy. Be it a valuable item, person or political power - something is within reach. This will likely be its own small adventure for the player party to engage with - if they so choose. 
> 
> Eventually, some henchmen of the PC's enemy make an appearance. They aim to challenge the player party. This is important - not just the one PC is involved, but **all of them**. This makes the PC's *personal concern*, a *party concern*. 
> 
> And so it goes on, with continually more escalating scenarios, which all culminate into the final confrontation, potentially many real-world sessions into the future, when the PC gets to put the final nail in that **ambition**'s coffin - and ***earn*** their [AFP](#ambition-fate-points).

#### Anchor Your PCs Down
Another resource, is a base of operations. This is a very meaningful and powerful tool, to anchor your PCs to a particular domain. Expect them to want to return to their base of operations regularly. While this *may* narrow the radius of exploration your players are willing to go, it doesn't necessarily have to. What it is guaranteed to do, however, is make your players care about *that space* in the world, in particular. 

Be mindful *where* in the world you give them such a resource, because that is where the players will want to spend a lot of time. Make sure it is a location where quests can easily come to them. Damsels in distress, kings in need and robbed merchants all require a reachable door to knock at. A very remote location might not see a lot of *action* or *visitors*. 

#### Limit & Threaten Resources
Assets exist to create mechanical challenges. Limit the PC's access to the resources they tend to hoard and dangle the proverbial carrot in front of them to motivate them through greed. 

Although your players could also be clever and find narrative solutions to their lack of *item vaccuuming*. If they can afford one or two carriages with the horses and drivers, perhaps even guards, they should be allowed to transport a lot more stuff around. Within the confines of their solution, of course. Those wagons full of ammunition, medical supplies and spare daggers will have to stay outside the cave/dungeon/ruin/etc. - unless your players can find a solution for that, too. 

Possessions in the form of coin and steel are not the only type of resource you can give your PCs. Keep in mind that servants, hirelings, close friends and family are *also a resource*. PCs can refer to them, when they have need of information, coin or political support. 

Of course, allow players to actually earn their rewards. When well deserved, they should be handed the proverbial carrot. 

Any resource you let a PC have, can be *threatened*. This is a powerful tool to raise tension among your players. Threaten their possessions, family or holdings - all the things they hold dear. 

If you have given them a small castle in a sparsely populated area, make sure to have someone threaten to take away that castle at least (and at most) **once**. By the time that happens, the players should have grown accustomed to having that safe space to return and haul loot to. Suddenly, their top-priority will be protecting that place. 

Once they've fended off the attackers, they'll really start caring about everything that's happening on or near their home turf. This is when wars and rumors become of much greater relevance to your players, as they don't want their assets (which they before took for granted) threatened *again*. 

In order to avoid frustrating your players, you shouldn't threaten their more valuable resources often. Used sparingly, this tool can cause great tension and players scrambling to find a creative solution. But used too frequently, your players might start getting frustrated, because you harm their sense of progression. If they never truly gain anything, why *should* they care if it is threatened? 

#### Allow World-Change
Have your players change your world. No matter what they do, the PCs' actions are going to leave ripples running through the world. 

If they ruthlessly slaughter a tribe of non-humans, they might inadvertently cause an increased radicalization among the other tribes of those same non-humans. Likewise, if the PCs go around protecting villages against raids, those villages might prosper and the villagers might offer gifts (like a warm meal and bed) to the PCs. 

On the other hand, if the players are actively trying to change a major aspect of the world, like the political structure in a neighboring country, allow it - but make it difficult. The players will have to work a bit to achieve that goal. Not just in terms of time invested, but in terms of creative preparation. 

This is the most powerful way to narratively challenge players. It helps them see your fictional world as *real* and they start thinking about the consequences of their actions more often. This encourages peaceful and creative solutions, where before they might have preferred blunt violence. 

### Keep Them Engaged
There is nothing worse than getting your players to "clock out" and stop paying attention to your game! This means they're not having fun and may even start wondering why they're even spending time at your table. If that keeps up, they'll inevitably leave. 

To avoid such a fate for your game, you must keep your players *hooked*! Keep them thinking that at any moment, they might get a chance to jump in and contribute just the right question, defuse a conflict or otherwise play out their character's strengths. 

#### Keep That Spotlight On a Swivel
It is only natural that some of your players may speak up before others. Whether they've simply got a dominant voice or immediately start talking, by doing so they'll probably discourage the others from speaking. 

Once you've identified which of your players tend to remain quiet, make sure **you give them the spotlight** every once in a while. 

Make sure to get a sense of who will **grab the spotlight** and who won't. Sometimes, you may even have to stop someone from grabbing it and instead allow one of the quieter players to act **first**. If the quieter player relinquishes the spotlight, let them. Don't force anyone into a situation they're uncomfortable with! 

Whenever you present your players with a new situation, especially with moments intended to *surprise* them, make sure to ask their characters' reactions! Go through each of your players and ask them, "how does your character react to this?" This allows each of them to play out their character and to breathe *life* into them. 

Also, when a decision must be made, like where the party will go and what they'll do next, make sure to ask **every** player. Nothing is worse than a player character being dragged along, even though their player isn't the least bit interested in the plot hook the others want to follow. By asking everyone, you may expose that some of them may have different plans. The goal then is to find a **compromise**! Do not let the one side of players force their will upon the others! Instead, encourage your players to find a way to motivate each other to follow the plot hook. Encourage them to find some reason or to be persuaded to go along. This way, no player feels left out in the decision-making process. 

Some players may not be interested in talking much. They might simply enjoy participating in your game a bit more passively than the others. However, if they're simply uncomfortable with improvisation, you may give them [Fair Warning](#fair-warning) and let them prepare an answer ahead of time. 

If you have any very passive players, you can still keep them engaged, by providing them other opportunities to shine. A skill test that only their character can even attempt, for example. Still, be observant of their reaction. Are they participating only reluctantly? If so, to re-iterate - don't force them to do anything they're uncomfortable with. Perhaps they're really having a good time just being there, enjoying the social aspect of being at your table, rather than the game itself. And that doesn't have to be a bad thing. If they're having a good time, then your efforts are well spent. 

#### Player Agency
A very important thing to remember is that **all decisions** are made **by your players**, not *you*. This is understood as "player-agency" - a player's ability to make a meaningful decision, which impacts your world and the story plot, even when in collision with your own expectations or plans. And their ability to dictate their own character's behavior. This may be one of *the most important* pieces of advice contained in this document. Their character, is a player's most valuable possession, at your table. Let them keep it. 

Ask your players, whenever there is a choice to be made, what their decision will be. *They* decide. You may of course make suggestions, based on the information you have given them. Suggestions that would be obvious to their characters, such as avoiding a confrontation that they should know they cannot win. But if the players decide to head into the confrontation regardless of your advice against it, let them. It is their choice to make. 

While it is certainly *work* to keep track of what everyone wants to do, the benefits of that work are significant. Your players are engaged, because they have agency in your world. This is where the beauty of role-playing games shines through. You're telling a story together, where the outcome is uncertain and surprises may happen at any time. 

Of course, there is an exception to every rule. You *can* take player-agency away, but there are conditions for doing so. Firstly, you must make it **absolutely clear** to your players, that for the given situation for a set amount of time, you'll dictate what happens. Secondly, you must have sound reason for dictating what happens. Whatever that reason is, it should be a rare instance, something that only happens as a special occasion. 

Even when a PC is mind-controlled by an enemy, you might still let the player control that character, but with goals that you (i. e. the enemy) dictate. If you trust the player to handle the situation well, playing the new role you have just given them, this can make for a very interesting and fun break from the usual line of thinking they'd subscribed to up to that point. 

For example, there may be times, when for storytelling purposes you may want to narrate something. Perhaps an event far away from the player characters. The term "cut-scene" is applicable. It's a moment when you take over as the narrator and narrate something that happens, that the players couldn't possibly have agency over. You *cut* into the current narrative by injecting another. Whenever doing so is appropriate, depends strongly on the story and your style of game. If done well, this can serve as a tool for world-building (investing your players in your world) and/or tension-building (drama!)

#### Rewards!
Nothing motivates players (and humans in general) more, than the promise of reward!

If you want your players to be curious about and engage with your world, then reward them for it! When a PC goes poking in ancient ruins seeping with lore, let them find some cool artifact. <br> 
If you want your players to kill monsters and defeat the "bad guys", reward them for it! Contractual monster-slaying is a classic hook. Money for pest control. 

Exactly how you present the promise of reward is up to you. Whether you hand out cards, in the format of goal - reward, or simply have NPCs that tell your player characters about rewards, will depend on what works best for you and your players. 

When presenting multiple options, avoid overloading your players with *too many* promises of reward. That could lead to analysis paralysis - the inability to prioritise and commit to a goal. This problem is exacerbated by timed rewards - rewards that will expire after a certain amount of time. If too many of those timed rewards exist, your players will find it very difficult to pick one, for fear of losing out on the other ones. 

To re-iterate - **reward behaviors** you wish to **encourage**. 

#### Fair Warning
Another tool in your bag, is the ability to give a player *fair warning* of something that will come up during the next session. 

This means telling a player well ahead of time that during the next session a situation may crop up in which they'll have to react. 

This is especially effective at allowing those players who're uncomfortable with improvisation to prepare themselves ahead of time. This helps them alleviate the feeling of nervousness and give them space to think. They may even surprise you with the answer they've cooked up! 

When giving such a *heads-up*, try to omit any details. Only give your player a basic prompt to work with. Just how much information the prompt should contain, will be up to you. 

> A prompt for a player could look like the following: "During the next session, an NPC will offer you a position of responsibility. Your character may decline, but their family may suffer a reputation loss as consequence."<br>
> Omit details about who that NPC is and what the position of responsibility will be. Even the consequences could be omitted. 
>
> Hopefully, this gives the player enough time to prepare an answer and a decision. If they require more information, you may of course give it, but try to avoid giving away *too* much about the planned narrative. Surprises should remain surprising, after all! 

### To Rule or Not To Rule
The rules serve to facilitate the resolution of uncertain outcomes, to add tension and drama and introduce challenges for the players to overcome. 

Obviously, as the **GM**, you have to know the rules well, so that you may make rulings. But you are not expected to know every single rule's details off the top of your head. You may have to look up rules, as you need them. 

When looking up rules, limit the time you take. If you take too long, players start getting bored and lose interest. If you cannot find the rule you're looking for quickly, skip the process and instead make a ruling, to the best of your knowledge and understanding of the situation at hand. This ensures you keep the game's pacing. A solid, fluent pace ensures your players stay interested. 

Rules *discussions* are best kept for after the game. When a player tries to argue a ruling, they're violating the unspoken social contract and are harming the game's pacing. It should be wise to move such discussions to a later point in time. But of course, there is an exception. When you find there is a rule of **STRIVE**, which really doesn't work out in the given situation, that's when you may need to consult your players to figure out how you'll house-rule it. Such breaks in play may not always be avoidable. Make sure to write down your house-rule, so that you may look it up quickly, the next time you encounter a similar situation. 

## Ending the Session
Finally, before parting ways, you and your players should stick around for some wind-down steps. 

### Hand Out Fate Points
You end every session by nominating players for [fate points](#fate-points) they earned during play. Players should also nominate and vote for each other. Whether someone gets their **FP** is based on majority vote. 

If you're short on time and have to end the session without voting for [fate points](#fate-points), make sure to do so at the start of the next session!

### Gather Feedback
While entirely up to you, it is always a good idea to gather feedback from your players. 

You could ask them the following:
* What was your favorite moment of today's session?
* What was your least favorite moment of today's session?
* Was the balance of combat vs. role-play to your liking?
* (If there was NPC-interaction) What was your favorite NPC interaction today?
  * Take note - that is an NPC you can *threaten* later, and have that player *care*. 

# NPC Builder
A Module may provide you with some pre-defined NPCs to work with, but you will most likely have to, and perhaps desire to, invent your own, too. This chapter aims to provide a step-by-step process for NPC creation, based on several parameters that you get to pick from. 

First, you must decide whether you need a **person**, an **animal** or a **monster**. A reminder from the [NPC](#non-player-characters-npcs) chapter:
* **People**: These are sentient, sapient and civilized folk, who can be reasoned with and interacted with on the same level as the PCs. See them as you do real people. There are no rules or mechanics dictating how they should behave, but they are *expected* to engage with the PCs and to react to the PCs' actions. 
* **Animals**: Sentient, but not sapient, these are creatures driven by animalistic instinct. They are neither inherently evil, nor good, and mostly care only about their base needs. Think wolves, bears, dogs and the like. But this may also be fantastical creatures, such as dragons, gryphons, space-whales and so on. 
* **Monsters**: Possibly sentient and/or sapient, these creatures can be of natural or unnatural origin and are usually irredeemably evil and destructive. Examples might be demons from an abyssal plane of existence, undead, constructs, robots and such. These are natural antagonists of the PCs and their origin cultures. 

Secondly, you must choose a **power-level**: 
**feeble**: `4` points
**regular**: `6` points
**elite**: `10` points
**legendary**: `20` points

## Roles
A creature's role informs you about how to best employ it in a combat encounter. When used within their role, they will perform better and be a more challenging foe. 

* **Ambusher**: Surprises foes, striking from stealth and tries to flank. Stays in the back-line or at their enemies' flanks. 
* **Artillery**: A back-liner who prefers to rain damage upon foes from afar. Usually very weak in melee. 
* **Brawler**: A front-liner that can hold their own, but relies on allies to finish the job. A solid middle-ground between Tank and Shock-Trooper. 
* **Commander**: A leader that lesser allies will rally around. Can improve their allies capabilities and will direct them to improve their efficacy. 
* **Guardian**: Protects allies. 
* **Sentry**: Observant and often stands guard. Willy call for aid, as soon as it notices anything out of the ordinary. 
* **Shock-Trooper**: Deals lots of damage, preferring to flank enemies. Doesn't usually survive much damage. 
* **Supporter**: Improves the capabilities of their allies and/or weakens foes. 
* **Tank**: Draws attention to itself and can survive a lot of punishment. Prefers the front-line. Tends to deal little damage, but may be good at disrupting enemy formations, for example by moving opponents around a lot. 
* **Trapper**: Lays traps and prepares the battlefield in advance or manipulates it during combat. 

## Traits
When choosing Traits from the lists below, keep in mind all of them are really just suggestions, to quickly get you started designing your own creatures. Once you get a feel for the numbers, for what *feels* like a balanced creature, you can easily expand the lists with your own Traits. In fact, you don't need to use the point-buy-system, at all, if you think you know how to make an interesting creature that won't hopelessly overwhelm the PCs.

Ultimately, what makes a creature *balanced* in terms of power and ability, so that it can reasonable be defeated, is to always give it some significant weakness. A creature that can easily deal lots of damage should be pretty weak itself, forcing it to take a cautious approach. A creature that can survive a lot of damage without batting an eye should probably not deal much damage itself. If you combine such strengths, make sure to give it some other weakness, like tying its ability to act to an environmental effect that triggers only once every other round or to another NPC which controls it. Perhaps its strength is only temporary or only effective when supported by allies. There are many ways in which a creature can have significant weaknesses for the PCs to find and exploit, which will please their players when they do. 

However, you are not limited to creating balanced creatures. You can also design deliberately *unfair* creatures, who are god-like in their powers. But if you do, be aware that the PCs should probably not be allowed to try and fight such a being. Or if you do allow them to try, have the creature put a "gentle" stop to it, like a parent scolding their child. Or perhaps the god-creature is so powerful it simply needn't care about what the PCs do, anyway. Such a being should likely result in a narrative challenge, rather than a combat one. This could also be the villain of the campaign, who starts off unfairly strong, but as the PCs progress through the campaign, they destroy the villain's sources of power and eliminate their allies, causing the villain to weaken and finally become defeatable.

`-3` points: **Precise**: Always deals `8` points of damage, instead.

#### Disease-Ridden (-1 point)

Useful for: Creatures of the night, such as werewolves, vampires and ghosts. 

## Skills
Custom Skills are that which brings the spice to every NPC. For people, you may simply give them Skills from the same lists as are available to the PCs. When choosing Skills to add to a NPC, you needn't add every single Skill they could potentially use at some point. You only need to give them those Skills that form their core strengths. The more Skills you add, the harder to manage a NPC becomes. 

Every Skill chosen should be at least level `2`.

# Core Rules Reminder Sheet

## Tests
* **Attributes** and **skills** can be tested. 
* **Ob** - "Obstacle": The number of **positives** that must be rolled to succeed a test. 
* Skills can be **forked**: **+1D** for a test for every other skill a character knows that is arguably related to what they're trying to achieve. 
* Skills and attributes **improve with use**. 
  * Skills require set numbers of **successes** and **failures**.
  * Attributes require only a set number of tests. 
  * Progress is only counted towards and based on the unmodified level. 
* **Characters can help** each other in tests: Like skill **forking**, but from a different character. 
  * **Helpers learn**: the outcome of the helped character is also their own.  
  * Skills can be **taught**

### Dice Results
* A **positive**: A D6 roll that resulted in a 5 or 6. 
* A **negative**: A D6 roll that resulted in a 1, 2, 3 or 4. 

### Types of Test
* **Binary** - The outcome of the test is either a **complete success** or **complete failure**.
* **Stepped**: A series of binary tests.
* **Graduated**: The number of **positives** rolled during the test factor into the outcome.
* **Creative**: Players choose the skill(s) or attribute(s) to use in a given situation. 
* **Opposed**: Two characters must roll. One side must achieve more **positives** than the other. 
  * **Ob** for the *attacker*: *defender* **positives** + 1. 

## Character

### Personality
* **Aspirations** should be a *conviction*, followed by an *actionable* goal to pursue.
* **Reaction**: An "if/then" and "always/never" statement.
  * **Troublemaker**: A detrimental reaction, that will get the character in *trouble* and earn them fate-points. 
  * **Assurance**: A beneficial reaction that acts as *insurance*, that the character won't be caught by surprise, but won't earn them fate-points. 
* Aspirations and reactions are expected to be changed in-between sessions. 
* **Personality traits change** as a character acts. 
* **Take note** of PCs acting in accordance to or against their personality.
* Acting in accordance to one's personality awards fate-points. 

### Health & Exhaustion
* Damage is inflicted upon HP and overflows. 
* When HP reach 0, an injury is suffered and HP is reset to the new maximum. 
  * Maximum HP are reduced by 2 per injury. 
* Only an active injury imposes negative effects, but injuries will always be counted toward the injury limit.
* Death or death's door occurs, when the injury limit is reached. 
* Injury exhaustion threshold: At half max. injuries (rounded down), every further damage mandates a toughness test (the Ob is the number of injuries). If failed, +1 exhaustion. 
* At maximum exhaustion, a character suffers the exhausted health state.
* An illness treatment attempt can only be made once every 24 hours. 
* Once removed, an injury may leave behind a scar.

## Combat
* Combat actions: Attack, move, speak, wait (= delay turn)
  * Attacks are made with skill abilities.
  * Attack modifiers: aimed, easy, execution
  * Waiting allows delaying one's turn to the end of a round. 
* Defense is a reaction.
  * **Active defense**: Costs 1 AP and allows using all available dice. 
    * **Stunts** are possible. 
  * **passive defense**: Costs no AP and only allows using half the available dice (rounded down). 
    * Happens automatically, if no active defense is attempted. 
    * Stunts are *not* possible. 
  * If successful, the attack is negated. 
    * Defending against AoE attacks is *only* possible as a passive defense and can *not* negate the attack. It can only halve (rounded up) its damage. 
* Cover
  * **Low cover**: +1 **Ob** against a target that is behind low cover. 
  * **High cover**: +2 **Ob** against a target that is behind high cover. 
* Throwing
  * Distance: bulk > 1 ?
    * no: strength * 15'/5m.
    * yes: (strength - (bulk - 1)) * 15'/5m.
  * Accuracy: round up (distance / 15'/5m)
  * Damage: 
    * Throwable weapon -> full damage of noted skill ability
    * Non-throwable weapon -> Half damage of chosen basic (= at level 0) skill ability
    * Non-weapon -> strength * bulk; bludgeoning damage

### Initiative
* Roll a D10 and add base initiative. 
  * Higher resulting numbers get an earlier turn. 

### Action Points
* 3 AP per turn. 
  * Basic actions cost 1 AP. 
  * Test requiring actions cost 2 AP.
  * Skill abilities cost variable AP.
* AP can be saved until the next turn.

* **Long Reach**: Allows attacking a target two squares (6'/2m) away. 
* **Very long Reach**: Allows attacking a target three squares (9'/3m) away. 
* **Range Only**: Implies a weapon cannot be used against any targets adjacent to self. 
* **Prefer Range**: +2 **Ob** to using the weapon against an adjacent target.
* **Slow Reload**: Reloading the weapon costs 1 [AP](#action-points-ap).
* **Very Slow Reload**: Reloading the weapon costs 2 [AP](#action-points-ap).
* **Ranged (throwable: < attack name >)**: No damage penalty is incurred when throwing this type of weapon. The damage formula for the given attack is to be used on hit. 
* A **counter-attack** is a *reaction* that allows a fighter being attacked to attack their attacker.

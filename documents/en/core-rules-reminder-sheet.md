# Ambersteel - Core Rules Reminder Sheet

## Tests
* **Attributes** and **skills** can be tested with their **modified level**. 
* **Ob** - "Obstacle": The number of **positives** that must be rolled to succeed a test. 
* Skills can be **forked**: **+1D** for a test for every other skill a character knows that is arguably related to what they're trying to achieve. 
* Skills and attributes **improve with use**. 
* **Characters can help** each other in tests: Like skill **forking**, but from a different character. 
  * **Helpers learn**: the outcome of the helped character is also their own.  
* Skills can be **taught**. The teacher must have at least one raw level higher than the student. 

### Dice Results
* A **positive**: A D6 roll that resulted in a 5 or 6. 
* A **negative**: A D6 roll that resulted in a 1, 2, 3 or 4. 

* **Opposed Tests**: Two characters must roll. One side must achieve *more* **positives** than the other. 
  * **Ob** for the *attacker*: *defender* **positives** + 1. 

## Character

### Personality
* **Aspirations** should be a *conviction*, followed by an *actionable* goal to pursue.
* **Reaction**: An "if/then" and "always/never" statement. **Troublemaker** or **assurance**.

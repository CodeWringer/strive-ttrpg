Version 3 (Playtest)

A role-playing game by Nicolas H.

# Introduction
This is the module containing the rules enabling play in a medieval fantasy game world, which includes supernatural monsters and magic. As such, only the differences and additions to the core rules are included in this document. 

This module is best suited for a low to medium fantasy setting. Adapting it to high or heroic fantasy will require extensive additions to the lists of **skills** and **skill abilities**. 

More details about the module:
* Magic is a **powerful** tool, but comes with great risk, with a chance for a spell to fail and back-fire. The chance of failure is manageable, however. 
  * Magic stamina is a new resource, that mages have to manage. 

# Character
New in this module, is the mental attribute [arcana](#arcana-arc), which governs a character's capacity for magic. 

## Mental Attributes
Supplements to the mental attributes. 

### Arcana [Arc]
Governs a character's ability to control and sense magic flow, thus casting magic spells or detecting lingering magic. 

This is the only attribute that can have a level of 0. Magical ability is innate and cannot be learned. If a character doesn't have a level of at least 1 in this attribute, they will be unable to advance it, at all. A non-mage will remain a non-mage (usually). 

## Health & Exhaustion
Supplements to specific health and exhaustion. 

### Hit Points (HP)
[Restoration magic](#restoration-emp) can restore all currently missing **HP** of a character, without the need for medical supplies. 

### State
Supplements to specific **health states**. 

#### Bleeding
[Restoration magic](#restoration-emp) can remove one or more points of **bleeding** at a time. 

#### Exhausted
An **exhausted** mage can no longer attempt to cast any magic. 

#### Poisoned
This state can also be removed with [restoration magic](#restoration-emp).

### Scars
Scars may be removed through successful application of [alteration](#alteration-int) magic. 

## Character Creation
Character creation is now supplemented by the following step, which follows determining the **exhaustion threshold**. 

The new procedure of creating a character consists of the following steps:
1. [Determine life path](#determine-life-path). 
2. [Determine species, sex & appearance](#species-sex--appearance).
3. [Determine name](#determine-name).
4. [Determine abilities](#determine-abilities).
6. [Determine **carrying capacity** and **assets**](#determine-assets).
7. [Determine **Max HP** and **Injury Maximum**](#determine-max-hp--injury-maximum)
8. [Determine exhaustion threshold](#determine-exhaustion-threshold).
9. [Determine magic stamina](#determine-magic-stamina).

### Determine Abilities
Next up, you can reinforce your character's [personality](#personality) with the abilities they have. Or even prepare a conflict of what your character *can* do and what they *think* they can do. 

#### Choosing Attributes
There are two methods for determining your character's attributes: manual and semi-random. 

You'll have to decide on whether your character will be a mage or not. Mages start with lower attributes, so this decision can affect your character's initial competence. 

Please keep in mind the values here are representative for an ordinary human about to enter an adventuring life. Other species may have modifiers on their attributes, making them better or worse in some of them. But that depends on the world your **GM** is running. 

This section replaces the section of the same name from the core rules. 

##### Manual Attribute Assignment
* As a **mage**
  * You can spend **12 points** on your attributes. 
  * **All** attributes start at level 1. 
  * Your attribute-total cannot be greater than **23**.
* As a **non-mage**
  * You can spend **16 points** on your attributes. 
  * All attributes **except arcana** start at level 1. Arcana is at 0 and remains at 0. 
  * Your attribute-total cannot be greater than **26**.
* No attribute may have a level less than 1 (exception: **arcana**) nor higher than 4.
* Only two attributes may have a level of 4. 

##### Semi-Random Attribute Assignment
1. For a **mage**
   1. Roll 11 **D4**
1. For a **non-mage**
   1. Roll 10 **D4**
1. Row up your dice to form a line, then read them from one end to the other and note each value. The order in which they are written down, is the order in which they'll be applied to the attributes. 
1. If there are more than 2 4s, start lowering their value by one, starting from the left or the right, until there are only 2 4s left. 
1. Count up the total of your values. 
   1. For a mage subtract your total from **26**. <br>
   For a non-mage subtract your total from **23**.
   1. If the number is negative, that's the number of levels you'll have to go down. <br>
   If the number is positive, that's the number of levels you'll have to go up. 
1. Starting from the left or right, start adjusting each value.
   1. If your levels have to go down, subtract one from each value. **But** skip 1s. 
   1. If your levels have to go up, add one to each value. But **don't** skip 4s. 
1. Repeat from the step of counting up your total and adjusting as necessary, until no more adjustments are necessary. 
1. Lastly, apply the adjusted values to your attributes. 

#### Choosing Skills
If playing a **mage**, keep in mind you need to have at least level 1 in a [magic school skill](#magic-school--school---attribute) to be able to cast magic. You are also advised to have your strongest magic be at least level 3 or 4, to be able to reliably use it. 

### Determine Magic Stamina
Determine your character's **maximum magic stamina**, by referring to the [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) section. 

You'll need to track **current magic stamina** separately. To start with, set your current to your maximum **magic stamina**. 

# Magic
Only a character with [arcana](#arcana-arc) can cast magic. What kind of magic, depends on the [magic schools](#list-of-magic-schools) the character knows. There are offensive, defensive and manipulative [schools of magic](#list-of-magic-schools). 

A *magic spell* is the intended effect of using a [magic school's](#magic-school--school---attribute-) [skill ability](./core-rules.md#skill-abilities). This is also referred to as *casting magic*, *casting a spell* or other similar wordings. In mechanical terms, every [skill ability](./core-rules.md#skill-abilities) noted on a [school of magic](#list-of-magic-schools) is a *magic spell*.

A mage can fail their [test](./core-rules.md#tests) and thus suffer a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire), which usually results in negative effects for the caster, instead of their intended target. 

[Spell intensity](#spell-intensity-si) adjusts the strength of a magic spell, as well as its cost in [magic stamina](#magic-stamina). 

## Spell Intensity (SI)
**Spell intensity** (shorthand **SI**) is the strength at which a magic spell is being cast. A higher number causes stronger and further reaching effects, at greater [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost. A spell's maximum intensity is dictated by the level in the corresponding [magic school skill](#magic-school--school---attribute).

For every point of a spell's chosen **spell intensity**, **1 D4** must be rolled. The sum of these rolls is the resulting [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost.

> For a spell at a chosen SI of 3, **3 D4** must be rolled. The sum of these rolls, which is at least 3 and at most could be 9, is the **magic stamina** to deduct after the spell's **test** is made. 

## Magic Stamina
Magic takes a toll on the caster's body, as it takes great mental effort to properly cast magic. **Magic stamina** represents a mage's capacity for casting magic without risk to themselves. It is a replenishable resource that is used up faster with [stronger spells](#spell-intensity-si). 

Mechanically speaking, every mage has two values to track: their **maximum magic stamina** and their **current magic stamina**. 
* The **maximum magic stamina** of a mage is derived from the **sum** of their [arcana](#arcana-arc) attribute * 2 plus the **raw levels** of all their known [magic school skills](#magic-school--school---attribute-). 
* The **current magic stamina** can not be less than 0 or more than their **maximum magic stamina**. Every time a mage casts a spell, they incur a **magic stamina** cost, based on the chosen [spell intensity](#spell-intensity-si), which is deducted from this number. 

> If a mage has an **arcana** of 3 and has the **magic school skills** **pyromancy** at level 3, **cryomancy** at level 2 and **illusion** at level 5, that means they have (3 + 3 + 2 + 5) = 13 **maximum magic stamina**. 

Once spent, **magic stamina** can only be regained through **active rest or meditation**. For every **half hour** spent in *active rest or meditation*, a mage regains **1 D4** **magic stamina**. Active rest or meditation implies not engaging in any physical or mental strains. If in doubt - if you have to do a test for it, it's probably a strain. 

Reaching negative **magic stamina** while casting a spell, results in an automatic [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire)! 

## Spell-Backfire
A **spell-backfire** causes a spell to affect the caster, instead of their intended target. The mage suffers the negative effects of the spell. In case of an [aoe](./core-rules.md#area-of-effect-aoe) attack spell, anyone or anything nearby the mage, in range, is also affected. Additionally, the mage suffers one point of [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion). 

It is possible for another nearby mage to prevent the **spell-backfire**, if they [negate the spell](#magic-negation) as a **reaction**. This also applies even if the spell wouldn't affect them. If the other mage's attempt to negate the spell *also* **backfires**, then both of the mages suffer the effect at one greater [intensity](#spell-intensity-si) level. 

A **spell-backfire** occurs in the following two cases: 
1. The [magic school skill test](#testing-magic) is a **complete failure**. 
2. The spell costs more [magic stamina](#magic-stamina), than the mage has available. 

> A mage has 3 **magic stamina** left, casts a spell at **SI** 1 and rolls a cost of 3 **magic stamina**. They reach 0 **magic stamina**, but do **not** suffer a **spell-backfire**. 

> Another example. This time, the mage has only 2 **magic stamina** left and rolls a cost of 3. This would result in them reaching negative **magic stamina** (= -1) and thus **does** cause a **spell-backfire**! Note, that the current magic stamina cannot be negative and instead is simply set to "0". 

## Concentration Spells
Some magic can be upheld for as long as the casting mage *concentrates* on their spell. Such spells will be marked with **"Concentration"**. The effects of a concentration spell last for as long as the mage *chooses* or *manages* to keep their concentration. They need only test for the spell only *once*, when they first cast it. 

A mage can only upkeep **one** concentration spell at a time. 

Concentration can be broken! Concentration is automatically broken, if the mage is incapacitated, for example by having been knocked unconscious. Otherwise, whenever the mage is *forced* to roll a [test](./core-rules.md#tests), they must **also** succeed another test of their concentration spell's magic school, at the same **Ob** as the test they were just forced to roll. 

## Magic Negation
It is possible to negate a magical attack entirely, by using the same **school of magic** **skill** and achieving more positives, than the attacker. The defender has to perform a [test](#testing-magic) of the same magic school, at the **Ob** equal to the number of **positives + 1** the attacker achieved. The defender does not get to use a [skill ability](#skill-abilities) of the magic school in question. This is a purely defensive action, which benefits everyone who might be hit with the spell of the attacker, as no one will be hit, if the defense is successful. 

If the defense fails, the full effect is applied. If the defense attempt causes a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire) on the defender, they suffer the attacker's spell at one greater [intensity](#spell-intensity-si) level. 

**Magic negation** can also be used to prevent another mage's [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire).

## Testing Magic
[Testing](./core-rules.md#tests) a [magic school skill](#magic-school--school---attribute-), in order to cast a *magic spell*, works as follows:
1. The mage determines the [spell intensity](#spell-intensity-si) they're going to use. Their level in the corresponding [magic school skill](#magic-school--school---attribute-) determines the maximum [spell intensity](#spell-intensity-si) they can pick. 
  1. Note that any spell **must** be cast with a [spell intensity](#spell-intensity-si) of *at least* 1. This includes **learning skills**. 
2. The [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost is determined. Roll **1 D4** for every point of the chosen [spell intensity](#spell-intensity-si). 
  1. If more magic stamina is used up, than the mage has left available, they suffer a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire).
  2. The [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) is reduced by the rolled sum. This happens regardless of a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire).
3. Proceed only if there was no [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire).
4. Determine the test's **Ob**. Some spells require an [opposed test](./core-rules.md#opposed-test), while others impose a fixed **Ob** and yet others have a dynamic **Ob**, based on some formula. 
5. The dice for the test are rolled. 
  1. If the test is a **complete success**, the spell is cast as intended. 
  2. If the test is a **partial success/failure**, the spell fizzles and nothing happens.
  3. If the test is a **complete failure**, the spell [back-fires](#spell-backfire). 

> A mage wants to cast an [illusion](#illusion-emp) spell, at SI 2. Their level in the corresponding magic school skill is 4. They have 4 magic stamina left. 
>
> They roll **2 D4**, yielding them a 3 and a 2. The sum (5) is one point more magic stamina, than the mage had left. They suffer a spell-backfire and their intended target is left unaffected!

> A mage wants to cast an [illusion](#illusion-emp) spell, at SI 2. Their level in the corresponding magic school skill is 4. They have 4 magic stamina left. 
>
> They roll **2 D4**, yielding them a 1 and a 2. The sum (3) is within their available magic stamina (which is now reduced to 1). 
>
> Now, they determine their **Ob** to be 2. They roll their 4 available D6, but achieve only 1 **positive**. Their spell fizzles and fails without any effect! 

## Magic Things
No fantasy world would be complete without materials with uses for the supernatural or artifacts of immense power. This section introduces the basics of these things. 

### Abyssalite
**Abyssalite** is a hard and brittle mineral, that has the ability to *amplify the flow of magic*. It can only be acquired from the depths of the earth and is fairly rare. 

Its surface is unnaturally smooth and covered in a fine, iridescent shine. Underneath the smooth surface, one searches for depth and color in vain. It is as though the void itself is being contained by that iridescent shell. However, the more magic flows through it, the stronger its shell shines. This means that when any magically gifted creature touches **Abyssalite**, it shines stronger. 

**Abyssalite** is a hard and brittle mineral, prone to shattering if too much force is applied. This makes it difficult to shape. It is also fairly heavy, which makes it difficult to carry long. 

A fist-sized **Abyssalite** chunk has a [bulk](#carrying-capacity) of 2 and grants one greater level in the respective school of magic, without costing any extra [magic stamina](#magic-stamina). In order to use the **Abyssalite**, the caster **must** be touching it. 

### Amberite
As magic is amplified by [Abyssalite](#abyssalite), its antithesis is called **Amberite**, a metal which dulls the effects of magic and slows any magic flow nearby it. The material is also known to affect magic creatures and can cause great pain in magic-users. 

Weapons made from **Amberite** are quite popular with witch and monster hunters alike, although fairly hard to come by, due to the difficulty in **Amberite** processing. 

**Amberite** is a crystalline material, that can be molten down and shaped, like iron. It glows weakly, in the fiery orange of the name-sharing amber stone. Near the edges, the glow fades to a dull reflection, like cooling molten glass. 

It only occurs naturally in a few select places in the world, where the ground offers the right conditions. **Amberite** grows over time, in the right environment. It can take several decades for a finger-sized crystal to grow to the size of an adult man's forearm. Attempts to cultivate it have mostly failed, as **Amberite** farmers have so far been unable to understand and reproduce the right conditions for it to thrive. Due to the slow rate at which it grows, an **Amberite** farmer may not realize the lack of growth until well into a decade later. 

Prolonged exposure to **Amberite** can cause severe ill-effects with nausea and migranes being common symptoms. 

### Ambersteel
**Ambersteel** is a strictly anti-magic material, it should enjoy great attention in any fantasy world, where magic is a real and recognizable force. Where usually, magic is the centerpiece, in **Ambersteel** that isn't quite the case. Magic is powerful and fearsome and thus, if not under control, can threaten to cause great pain and destruction. **Ambersteel** dampens that power and puts shackles on it. 

[Amberite](#amberite) can be processed into **Ambersteel**, which makes it a hard and flexible metal. The raw material heats slowly and must be heated over the course of several days and nights, without interruption. When it finally reaches the right temperature, it will glow white, with a purple sheen. At that point, it can be hammered into shape. Constant re-heating ensures it stays at the right temperature and a final quenching in vegetable oil ensures it retains its flexibility. 

If processed outside the optimal temperature, the material quickly grows brittle and will shatter if any stress is put on it.

Due to the length of the process and the difficulty in keeping the right temperature, smiths capable of creating **Ambersteel** are rare. 

### Runes
Shards of [Abyssalite](#abyssalite) can have runes carved into them, which allow magic to flow through the runes. This renders runes extremely powerful artifacts, as they can allow for near limitless magic-use, even in the hands of a non-mage. 

To activate such a rune, is a difficult skill to learn, however. Even if no innate magical ability is required, an understanding of the flow of magic is. The rune must be touched in the right spots, at the right intervals, to activate successfully. Mistakes in this procedure can have disastrous results. 

What's more, it takes great skill to carve the right runes, as each rune's shape and complexity depends in part on the size and shape of the [Abyssalite](abyssalite) shard. The only way to get it right, is to *feel* the way the rune must be shaped. Alternatively, the shard can be adjusted to be of equivalent size and shape, but this requires considerable effort, as [Abyssalite](abyssalite) is a brittle material, prone to shattering if too much force is applied. 

In order to craft a **rune**:
* A **rune** can only be made to cast one type of magic. So the carver has to pick one of the [magic schools](#magic-schools). 
* The maximum **level** at which a **rune** can be created, depends on the carver's skill. The **level** of the **rune** dictates the level of the respective magic it will cast at. 
* The carver has to succeed a [rune carving](#rune-carving-arc) skill test. 
  * If they fail, the carving is botched and the [Abyssalite chunk](#abyssalite) cannot be used for another carving attempt. There is no room for mistakes. 

In order to invoke a **rune**:
* A **complete success** of a [rune-using](#rune-using-agi) skill test will invoke the spell of the **rune** as expected.
* A **partial success** or **complete failure** results in a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire). 

# Assets

## Weapon Properties
Weapon type assets can have the following **properties**:
* **Ambersteel-Lined**: Bonus damage against mages and magical creatures: **+1** for every quality level. **+1D4** for every two **quality levels**, starting at level 1.
* **Ambersteel-Plated**: Bonus damage against mages and magical creatures: **+1** for every quality level. **+1D6** for every two **quality levels**, starting at level 1.
* **Ambersteel-Forged**: Bonus damage against mages and magical creatures: **+2** for every quality level. **+1D8** for every two **quality levels**, starting at level 1.

# Appendix
The appendix contains important and less important lists, for reference only when needed. 

## List of Assets
The following list does not and cannot aim to be a complete listing of all possible assets in game. Adding new assets as necessary will have to be done by the **GM**. 

### Armor

#### Armor Properties
Armor can have the following **properties**:
* **Ambersteel-Lined**: Bonus protection from magic: **+1** for every quality level. **+1D4** for every two **quality levels**, starting at level 1.
* **Ambersteel-Plated**: Bonus protection from magic: **+1** for every quality level. **+1D6** for every two **quality levels**, starting at level 1.
* **Ambersteel-Forged**: Bonus protection from magic: **+2** for every quality level. **+1D8** for every two **quality levels**, starting at level 1.

> An ambersteel-lined armor at quality level 3 would have +(3 + **2D4**) protection from magic. 

#### Armor Types
Armor reduces damage to its wearer by a flat amount. By how much, is specific to each armor type. Some armors can have special protections or effects. 

##### Light Armor
A set of light armor that doesn't impede the wearer by much. Commonly represents a gambeson or other cloth defense. 

* Bulk: 2

| Protections                 |
| --------------------------- |
| 3 + **1D6** **Slashing**    |
| 2 + **1D6** **Bludgeoning** |
| 1 + **1D6** **Piercing**    |
| **1D6** **Crushing**        |

##### Medium Armor
A set of medium armor with a good balance of protection and weight. Commonly represents mail armor. Common headgear: arming cap, mail coif or any non-full helmet. 

* Bulk: 3
* Causes a permanent +1 [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion) while worn. 

| Protections                 |
| --------------------------- |
| 4 + **1D6** **Slashing**    |
| 3 + **1D6** **Bludgeoning** |
| 2 + **1D6** **Piercing**    |
| 1 + **1D6** **Crushing**    |

##### Heavy Armor
A set of heavy armor with excellent protection, at the cost of encumbering the wearer greatly. Commonly represents a full suit of plate armor.

### Shield Types
Shields are items that provide passive bonuses to defense against melee and ranged attacks and require one free hand to use. This implies they cannot be used at the same time as a two-handed weapon (unless of course if you have more than two arms). 

##### Buckler
A small, round shield commonly held as far from the body as possible, to deflect small or stabbing weapons with ease. Helps only little against heavy blows, however. And don't expect to deflect arrows with this, either. 

* Bulk: 1

| Defensive Bonus       |
| --------------------- |
| +1D for melee defense. |
| +3D for melee defense against **stabbing** attacks. |

##### Round Shield
A medium-sized, round shield made from tough wood and leather, which offers decent protection against most attacks, while not encumbering the wielder too much. 

* Bulk: 2

| Defensive Bonus      |
| -------------------- |
| +2D for any defense. |

##### Heater Shield
A tough and heavy metal shield, which offers great protection, while still being somewhat manageable to wield. 

* Bulk: 3
* +1 [exhaustion](#exhaustion) while wielded

| Defensive Bonus      |
| -------------------- |
| +3D for any defense. |

##### Kite Shield
A large, kite-shaped shield, which can protect every part of the fighter, from the shoulder down to the feet. Its weight makes it difficult to react to attacks quickly, hoever. 

* Bulk: 4
* +2 [exhaustion](#exhaustion) while wielded

| Defensive Bonus      |
| -------------------- |
| +4D for any defense. |

### List of Stuff & Things
The following is a list of general assets. Of course, the following list is non-exhaustive. Invent more at your own need. 

| Name                   | Max. Stack Size | Description                                                              |

| Laudanum Potion        | 1    | This wonderous substance can quell pain and calm nerves within seconds. Also effective against diarrhea. Upon imbibing, sets one **active** [injury](./core-rules.md#injury) to **patched up**. After 24 hours, the [injury](./core-rules.md#injury) is set back to **active**, even if it was **treated** in the meantime. Also, must succeed a [willpower](./core-rules.md#willpower-will) test at **Ob** 2, or else become [addicted](./core-rules.md#drug-addicted) to the stuff. |
| Calming Tea            | 1    | This herbal tea has the ability to calm nerves. Removes [berserk](./core-rules.md#berserk), [jealous](./core-rules.md#jealous) and [terrified](./core-rules.md#terrified). Best enjoyed steaming hot, but not necessarily. |

### Weapon Types
Following are fantasy-themed weapon types. 

For ranged weapons there is note made of a value called the "distance increment". This describes the distance within which the weapon can be used optimally, for no penalty to **Ob** and damage. As soon as a shooter wants to hit a target past their initial (= optimal) distance increment, they incur a penalty as noted on the attack in question. This penalty is multiplied by every increment past the initial. 

> For example, when a distance increment of 30'/10m has been noted, then shooting anything within and up to that distance incurs no penalties. But as soon as the shooter wants to hit something at 33'/11m distance, they incur their first penalty. The next penalty is incurred at 63'/21m and so on. 

#### Dagger (Agi)
Any very short, one-handed blade. Examples: shiv, dagger, rondel-dagger

* -1 **Ob** and +**Agi\*D** damage against [proned](./core-rules.md#prone) and [grappled](./core-rules.md#grappled) targets.

## Lists of Skills
The following list does not and cannot aim to be a complete listing of all possible skills in game. Adding new skills as necessary will have to be done by the **GM**. 

### Physical Skills
These skills have a dominant physical aspect and are directly tied to a character's *physical attributes*. 

#### Rune-Using (Agi)

#### Sailing (Str)
Steering and maintaining a naval vessel. 

### Knowledge Skills
These skills have a dominant mental aspect and are strongly related to a character's *mental attributes*. 

#### Heraldry (Int)
The ability to tell noble houses apart and to know their heraldry. 

#### Magic School < School > (< Attribute >)
Knowledge and experience in a specific [magic school](#list-of-magic-schools). 

See also [testing magic](#testing-magic). 

### Craftsmanship Skills
All craftsmanship requires a mix of physical and mental attributes, for the purpose of creating a wide variety of things.

#### Armor smithing (Str)
The ability to make armor from conventional materials, such as metal and leather. 

| Product                              | Complexity | Workload  | Materials                              | Quality Bonus   |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------- | 
| 1 [light armor](#light-armor)        | High       | High      | Any shapeable sturdy and flexible material, such as iron, steel, leather or chitin. | Every **positive**: +1 **Slashing**; Every 2 **positives**: +1 **Bludgeoning**; Every 3 **positives**: +1 **Crushing**, +1 **Piercing** |
| 1 [medium armor](#medium-armor)      | High       | Very High | Any shapeable sturdy and flexible material, such as iron, steel, leather or chitin. | Every **positive**: +1 **Slashing**; Every 2 **positives**: +1 **Bludgeoning**; Every 3 **positives**: +1 **Crushing**, +1 **Piercing** |

#### Ambersmithing (Agi)
The ability to make armor from [amberite](#amberite). 

Lining or plating an existing object with [ambersteel](#amberite) acts as an improvement, whereas an [ambersteel](#amberite)-forged object is an entirely new object, completely made out of [ambersteel](#amberite). 

The product effects do not stack, but they can be overridden. This means that the same object cannot be lined with [ambersteel](#amberite) twice, for cumulative effects. But it can be upgraded to [ambersteel](#amberite)-plated.

## List of Magic Schools
The capabilities of the various magic schools are described by the [skill abilities](#skill-abilities) associated with each of them. The concrete effects are kept vague on purpose, to allow a certain freedom when choosing how the magic is expressed. But the intensity or strength of a casting is tied to the level of the [magic school skill](#magic-school--school---attribute-). 

The levels noted for each magic school represent the effects a mage can achieve, when casting that particular type of magic. Stronger effects generally require a higher level. 

See also [testing magic](#testing-magic). 

In all the following tables, note the following:
* Replace *SI* with the chosen [spell intensity](#spell-intensity-si). 
* *Level* is the prerequisite level of the **magic school skill**, at which a given spell becomes available for use. 

### Alteration (Int)
The alteration of physical things, to change their shape and purpose, permanently. 

Note that altering the shape of creatures poses a particular challenge. Unless if the test is a **complete success**, the target creature may mutate, horribly. When failing a test, consult the [list of mutations](#list-of-mutations), to determine the type of mutation. 

Creatures can [resist](#resist-will) the change. Inanimate objects don't resist. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |

The complexity and size of the re-shaping depends on the **SI**. 1-3 are for simple and small, 4-6 for tricky and medium, 7-8 for complex and large and 9+ for very complex and very large alterations. Consult your **GM**! | The intended alteration occurs only on the caster. |

### Cryomancy (Arc)

The summoning and control of fire. The flame being a destructive force, pyromancers enjoy little utility from their magic, beyond the ability to create light and heat.

They and anyone in the radius suffers the damage. |

### Restoration (Emp)
The mending of [injuries](./core-rules.md#injury) and treatment of [diseases](./core-rules.md#illness).

### Soul-Binding (Int)
Also referred to as **necromancy**, this is the art and skill of calling souls from the **plane of the dead** and binding them, to reanimate corpses or animate an otherwise unliving body. 

In order to bind a soul, a **soul-seal** is required. This seal has to take the form of a pentagram. The medium doesn't matter, although if the seal is destroyed, the soul binding is broken. So, if a mage wants to create a lasting soul-binding, an enduring medium for the seal is advisable. 

A mage can only ever issue commands to a soul that they've bound. It is not possible to command souls bound by other mages. 

A **soul-binding** can be broken, but it in order to do so, a **soul-binding** test at **Ob** equal to the strength of the **soul-binding** must be **completely succeeded**. It is possible to lift a **soul-binding** made by another mage. 

An important note about **completely failing** a **soul-binding** attempt - a **complete failure** results in the spell-backfiring and displacing the mage's soul with the one they were trying to bind. Their soul is essentially evicted from their own body and sent to the **plane of the dead**. The soul they tried to bind then takes over their body. 

Another important note about targeting a specific soul. It is easier to recall the soul that previously inhabited a body, the shorter the time of death has been. However, targeting a specific soul is an immensely difficult undertaking and shouldn't be taken lightly. For every day past the original time of death, the difficulty of recalling the soul increases by **1 Ob**. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance   | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |
| ----- | -------------------- | -- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 0     | Call and Bind a Soul | 3  | 3'/1m      | SI                           | Create a **soul-binding** at the strength of the chosen level. The larger, heavier and more complex a body is, the harder it is to create a binding. Anything larger than, heavier or more complex than a human will make the **soul-binding** harder. 1-3 for a small and simple, 4-5 for a moderate and 6+ for a large and complex binding. Consult your **GM**. Requires a **soul-seal**. Replacing an existing binding is possible, but the test must exceed the original soul-seals strength. | The caster's soul is evicted from their body and another soul takes place. The caster's character is effectively removed from the world. |
| 1     | Command Bound Soul   | 1  | SI * 6'/3m | Opposed: Resist at 6 - SI    | Issue a single command that the bound soul **must** follow. | +1 [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion) to the caster. |
| 1     | Break Binding        | 3  | 3'/1m      | SI of the seal               | Break a **soul-binding** and send the soul back to the **plane of the dead**, leaving its former body inanimate and soulless. | The caster's soul is evicted from their body and another soul takes place. The caster's character is effectively removed from the world. |
| 5     | Call back a Soul     | 3  | 3'/1m      | SI + days since death        | Target a specific soul and recall them into their prior body. This isn't, strictly speaking, the same as binding a soul. | The caster's soul is evicted from their body and another soul takes place. The caster's character is effectively removed from the world. |

### Telekinesis (Int)
The ability to affect things and even creatures from afar, using magic instead of muscles or tools. 

When using objects as projectiles, choose the [damage type](#damage-types) as appropriate. For example, a crossbow bolt might cause **piercing** damage, while a rock might cause **crushing** damage.

The mage can only ever perform *one* movement with a spell cast. So, for example, it is not possible to violently shake things or creatures around, without casting **telekinesis** multiple times, to do so. During combat, every movement takes one turn. Out of combat, about five seconds. A single movement is a displacement from one point to another, in a straight and uninterrupted line. 

Only targets within and up to the given *distance* can be moved and only within and up to that *distance* from the mage.

### Telepathy (Ora)
The ability to communicate wordlessly, to alter emotions and even issue compelling commands against another's will. 

The mage can only affect those creatures that either don't resist, or which **fail** a [resist](#resist-will) test, at the given **Ob**. 

| Level | Name                   | AP | Distance     | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |

| 6     | Quiet Command          | 3  | SI * 30'/10m | Opposed: Resist - SI         | Issue a command to another creature, which they feel **strongly** compelled to follow. | The caster is affected, instead. |

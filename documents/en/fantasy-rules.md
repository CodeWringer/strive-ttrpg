Version 9 (Playtest)

A role-playing game by Nicolas H.

# Introduction
This is the module containing the rules enabling play in a medieval fantasy game world, which includes supernatural monsters and magic. Only the differences and additions to the core rules are included in this document. 

This module is best suited for a medium fantasy setting. It introduces magic, which is a **powerful** tool, that comes with great risk. Mages who exert themselves too much may fail their spell cast, which results in a back-fire. But the likelihood of failure is manageable.

The module introduces:
* The [Arcana](#arcana-arc) attribute.
* [Magic](#magic) rules.
* Medieval/fantasy themed [armors](#armor), [shields](#shield-types), [general assets](#list-of-general-assets), [weapons](#weapon-types) and [skills](#lists-of-skills).

# Character
New in this module, is the attribute [arcana](#arcana-arc), which governs a character's capacity for magic. 

## Attributes
Supplements to the [core attributes](./core-rules.md#attributes). 

### Arcana [Arc]
Governs a character's ability to control and sense magic flow, casting magic spells or detecting lingering magic. 

This is the only attribute that can have a level of `0`, meaning playing a mage is a deliberate choice. 

# Magic
For this supplement, magic is assumed to be a mostly invisible supernatural force that runs all throughout, like a magnetosphere. Perhaps it could be called the *Arcanosphere*. How magic manifests itself, is up to the world the **GM** is running. Is there a verbal component? Must the mage trace arcane symbols into the air or onto some surface? Are the magical currents visible and glow eerily? This supplement makes no assumptions in this regard. 

Only a character with [Arcana](#arcana-arc) can cast magic at will. What kind of magic, depends on the [magic schools](#list-of-magic-schools) the character knows. There are offensive, defensive and manipulative [schools of magic](#list-of-magic-schools). 

There may also be magic artifacts that can either cause magical effects on their own, or through character interaction. With such artifacts, it may be possible for non-mages to cast magic. For that, see [runes](#runes) and [scrolls](#magic-scrolls). 

A *magic spell* is the intended effect of using a [magic school's](#magic-school--school---attribute-) [Expertises](./core-rules.md#expertise). Using such an Expertise is also referred to as *casting magic*, *casting a spell* or other similar wordings. In mechanical terms, the [Expertises](./core-rules.md#expertise) are the *spells* of a [school of magic](#list-of-magic-schools).

A mage can fail their [test](./core-rules.md#tests) and thus suffer a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire), which usually results in negative effects for the caster, instead of their intended target. 

[Spell Intensity](#spell-intensity-si) sets the strength of a magic spell and how much [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) and [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat) it causes. 

## Testing Magic
[Testing](./core-rules.md#tests) a [magic school skill](#magic-school--school---attribute-), in order to cast a *magic spell*, works as follows:

1. Determine the [Spell Intensity](#spell-intensity-si) (SI) to use. 
   1. The level in the corresponding [magic school skill](#magic-school--school---attribute-) determines the maximum [SI](#spell-intensity-si) that can be picked. 
   1. Note that any spell **must** be cast with a [SI](#spell-intensity-si) of *at least* `1`. This includes **learning skills**. 
2. Determine the test's **Ob**. 
   1. Some spells require an [opposed test](./core-rules.md#opposed-test), while others impose a fixed **Ob** and yet others have a dynamic **Ob**, based on some formula. 
3. The dice for the test are rolled. 
4. Convert the [SI](#spell-intensity-si) to [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) and [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat). 
   1. If this brings the mage to a new [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat) threshold, its effects now apply. 

## Spell Intensity (SI)
**Spell Intensity (SI)** is the strength at which a magic spell is being cast. A higher number causes stronger and further reaching effects, but also more [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) and [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat). 

A spell's **maximum intensity** is dictated by the level in the corresponding [magic school skill](#magic-school--school---attribute-). However, the minimum **SI** for a spell cast is **always** `1`. 

When a mage casts magic, **half** (rounded down and minimum `1`) of the [Spell Intensity](#spell-intensity-si) they choose equals the amount of [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) that builds up within them. The other half turns into [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat). 

> = A spell cast at **SI** `1` causes `+1` **Arcane Slag** and *no* **Arcane Overheat**. 
> 
> = A spell cast at **SI** `3` causes `+1` **Arcane Slag** and `+2` **Arcane Overheat**. 
> 
> = A spell cast at **SI** `6` causes `+3` **Arcane Slag** and `+3` **Arcane Overheat**. 

## Arcane Overheat
Magic takes a toll on the caster's body and mind. As magic currents flow through their body, **Arcane Overheat** and [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) build up within them. Too much **Arcane Overheat**, and the mage will suffer various negative effects! 

When a mage casts magic, **half** (rounded down and minimum `1`) of the [Spell Intensity](#spell-intensity-si) they choose equals the amount of [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) that builds up within them. The other half turns into [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat). 

> = A spell cast at **SI** `1` causes `+1` **Arcane Slag** and *no* **Arcane Overheat**. 
> 
> = A spell cast at **SI** `3` causes `+1` **Arcane Slag** and `+2` **Arcane Overheat**. 
> 
> = A spell cast at **SI** `6` causes `+3` **Arcane Slag** and `+3` **Arcane Overheat**. 

[Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) represents the base **Arcane Overheat** of a character, which can not be reduced as quickly as the more fleeting **Arcane Overheat**. Note that non-mages may be affected by this, too!

> A character with an **Arcane Slag** of `3`, always has at least `3` **Arcane Overheat**!

The [Arcana](#arcana-arc) attribute determines several thresholds. If the character has an [Arcana](#arcana-arc) level of less than `1`, calculate the thresholds as if it was level `1`. 

* **Cold**: Up to and including the `modified Arcana` is **mostly safe**. 
  * Every time the mage casts a spell, if they don't achieve at least `1` **hit**, a [Spell-Backfire](#spell-backfire) occurs. In other words, only a **complete failure** of the [test](#testing-magic) results in a [Spell-Backfire](#spell-backfire). 
* **Smoldering**: Up to and including the `modified Arcana * 2` is **risky**. 
  * Every time the mage casts a spell, their **Ob** is always increased by `+1`. If they don't achieve at least `2` **hits**, a [Spell-Backfire](#spell-backfire) occurs. 
* **Broiling**: Up to and including the `modified Arcana * 3` is **perilous**. 
  * Every time the mage casts a spell, their **Ob** is always increased by `+2`. If they don't achieve at least `3` **hits**, a [Spell-Backfire](#spell-backfire) occurs. 
  * For **all** *other* tests, the mage suffers `-1D`. 
* **Consuming**: Anything past the point of **Broiling** is **mortally perilous**. 
  * The mage suffers `1D8 + 2` [Pure damage](./core-rules.md#damage-types) every [Tick](./core-rules.md#ticks). 
  * **Every** further attempt to cast a spell instantly **fails**. The mage simply cannot cast magic for as long as their **Arcane Overheat** is ***Consuming*** them. That means there is no [Spell-Backfire](#spell-backfire), either. 
  * For **all** *other* tests, the mage suffers `-2D`. 

> The thresholds of a mage with an Arcana of `3` are: `0-3` Cold, `4-6` Smoldering, `7-9` Broiling and `10+` Consuming. 

At the start of every turn, or every `5` seconds outside combat, a mage automatically reduces their **Arcane Overheat** by one point. They can actively **vent** their **Arcane Overheat** further - one point per [AP](./core-rules.md#action-points-ap) spent. 

## Arcane Slag
**Arcane Slag** is the build-up of residual magical currents within the character's body. You can think of these like residual radioactive particles, that only slowly escape the body, albeit less immediately harmful. 

For every point of **Arcane Slag** that has built up within a character, their base [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat) is increased by the same amount. They cannot reduce their [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat) to less than this amount. 

When a mage casts magic, **half** (rounded down and minimum `1`) of the [Spell Intensity](#spell-intensity-si) they choose equals the amount of [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) that builds up within them. The other half turns into [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat). 

> = A spell cast at **SI** `1` causes `+1` **Arcane Slag** and *no* **Arcane Overheat**. 
> 
> = A spell cast at **SI** `3` causes `+1` **Arcane Slag** and `+2` **Arcane Overheat**. 
> 
> = A spell cast at **SI** `6` causes `+3` **Arcane Slag** and `+3` **Arcane Overheat**. 

`1` point of **Arcane Slag** automatically leaves the character's body, every `6` hours. If that time is spent in active rest or meditation - that means doing *nothing* besides rest -, then `2` points leave the body, instead. 

**Arcane Slag** *can* affect non-mages, too! That implies they can also suffer [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat) (although that does not make them mages)! 

## Spell-Backfire
A **spell-backfire** causes a spell to affect the caster, instead of their intended target. The mage suffers the negative effects of the spell.

In case of an [aoe](./core-rules.md#area-of-effect-aoe) attack spell, anyone or anything nearby the mage, in range, is also affected. Additionally, the mage suffers one point of [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion). 

It is possible for another nearby mage to prevent the **spell-backfire**, if they [negate the spell](#magic-negation) as a **reaction**. This also applies even if the spell wouldn't affect them. If the other mage's attempt to negate the spell *also* **backfires**, then both of the mages suffer the spell's effect at one greater [intensity](#spell-intensity-si) level. 

A **spell-backfire** occurs in the following two cases: 
1. The [magic school skill test](#testing-magic) is a **complete failure**. 
2. The mage suffers from [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat) and rolls a failure. 

## Concentration Spells
Some magic can be upheld for as long as the casting mage *concentrates* on their spell. Such spells will be marked with **"Concentration"**. The effects of a concentration spell last for as long as the mage *chooses* or *manages* to keep their concentration. They need only test for the spell only *once*, when they first cast it. After that, during combat, it costs `1` AP at the start of every turn to uphold it. 

Under normal circumstances, a mage can only upkeep **one** concentration spell at a time. 

Concentration can be broken! Concentration is automatically broken, if the mage is incapacitated, for example by having been knocked unconscious. Otherwise, whenever the mage is *forced* to roll a [test](./core-rules.md#tests), they must **also** succeed another test of their concentration spell's magic school, at the same **Ob** as the test they were just forced to roll. 

## Magic Negation
It is possible to negate a magical attack entirely, by using the same **school of magic** **skill** and achieving more **hits**, than the attacker. The defender has to perform a [test](#testing-magic) of the same magic school, at the **Ob** equal to the number of **hits + 1** the attacker achieved. The defender does not get to use a [expertise](./core-rules.md#expertise) of the magic school in question. This is a purely defensive action, which benefits everyone who might be hit with the spell of the attacker, as no one will be hit, if the defense is successful. 

If the defense fails, the full effect is applied. If the defense attempt causes a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire) on the defender, they suffer the attacker's spell at one greater [intensity](#spell-intensity-si) level. 

**Magic negation** can also be used to prevent another mage's [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire).

## Protection From Magic
Armor made from [Ambersteel](#ambersteel) can reduce the damage suffered through magical sources and reduce the [SI](#spell-intensity-si) of non-damaging spells. 

The [quality](./core-rules.md#crafting) of an armor or shield determines how much it protects the wearer. See [ambersmithing](#ambersmithing-strwit) for the specific numbers. 

Damage from magical sources is reduced by the quality level + a number of dice. Non-damaging spells have their [SI](#spell-intensity-si) reduced by *only* the quality level. 

## Magic Echoes
Whenever magic is cast, a pale reflection of it remains, invisible to the naked eye, lingering for `SI * 4` hours, based on the magic spell's [intensity](#spell-intensity-si) when it was cast. 

Those sensitive to magic can detect it and if they know the [magic school](#magic-school--school---attribute-) whence the spell stems, they instinctively recognize the echo. Otherwise, they may need to succeed an [Arcana](#arcana-arc) test at Ob `2` to determine the type of magic that was cast. With another test, also at Ob `2`, they may also determine a rough estimate of how old the echo is. 

Each echo has a unique aspect to it, like a finger-print. It is possible to capture a magic echo's finger-print, as well as some of the context when it was cast, in special devices, called [Magic Recorders](#list-of-general-assets). 

## Magic Things
No fantasy world would be complete without materials with uses for the supernatural or artifacts of immense power. This section introduces the basics of these things. 

Aside from the materials listed below, you are of course free to invent more as desired. 

### Abyssalite
**Abyssalite** is a hard and brittle mineral, that has the ability to *amplify the flow of magic*. It can only be acquired from the depths of the earth and is fairly rare. 

Its surface is unnaturally smooth and covered in a fine, iridescent shine. Underneath the smooth surface, one searches for depth and color in vain. It is as though the void itself is being contained by that iridescent shell. However, the more magic flows through it, the stronger its shell shines. This means that when any magically gifted creature touches **Abyssalite**, it shines stronger. 

**Abyssalite** is a hard and brittle mineral, prone to shattering if too much force is applied. This makes it difficult to shape. It is also fairly heavy, which makes it difficult to carry. 

A fist-sized **Abyssalite** chunk has a [bulk](./core-rules.md#carrying-capacity) of 2 and grants one greater level in the respective [school of magic](#magic-school--school---attribute-), without causing any additional [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat). In order to use the **Abyssalite**, the caster **must** be touching it. 

### Amberite
As magic is amplified by [Abyssalite](#abyssalite), its antithesis is called **Amberite**, a metal which dulls the effects of magic and slows any magic flow nearby it. The material is also known to affect magic creatures and can cause great pain in magic-users. 

Weapons made from **Amberite** are quite popular with witch and monster hunters alike, although fairly hard to come by, due to the difficulty in **Amberite** processing. 

**Amberite** is a crystalline material, that can be molten down and shaped, like iron. It glows weakly and translucently, in the fiery orange of the name-sharing amber stone. Near the edges, the glow fades to a dull reflection, like cooling molten lava. 

It only occurs naturally in a few select places in the world, where the ground offers the right conditions. **Amberite** grows over time, in the right environment. It can take several decades for a finger-sized crystal to grow to the size of an adult man's forearm. Attempts to cultivate it are met with extreme difficulty. The right conditions for it to thrive are highly dependent on the soil's components, the influence of the *arcanosphere* and proximity to volcanic activity. Due to the slow rate at which it grows, an **Amberite** farmer may not realize the lack of growth until well into a decade later. 

Prolonged exposure to **Amberite** can cause severe ill-effects with nausea and migranes being common symptoms. 

A fist-sized **Amberite** chunk is fairly heavy, with a [bulk](./core-rules.md#carrying-capacity) of 3. 

### Ambersteel
**Ambersteel** is a strictly anti-magic material. It should enjoy great attention in any fantasy world, where magic is a real and recognizable force. Magic is powerful and fearsome and thus, if not under control, can threaten to cause great pain and destruction. **Ambersteel** dampens that power and puts shackles on it. 

[Amberite](#amberite) can be processed into **Ambersteel**, which makes it a hard and flexible metal. The raw material heats slowly and must be heated over the course of several days and nights, without interruption. When it finally reaches the right temperature, it will glow white, with a purple sheen. At that point, it can be hammered into shape. Constant re-heating ensures it stays at the right temperature and a final quenching in oil mixed with powdered [Abyssalite](#abyssalite) ensures it retains its flexibility. If processed outside the optimal temperature, the material quickly grows brittle and will shatter if any stress is put on it. The skill to use is [ambersmithing](#ambersmithing-strwit). 

Due to the length of the process and the difficulty in keeping the right temperature, smiths capable of creating **Ambersteel** are rare. 

**Ambersteel** is also a fairly heavy material, albeit slightly lighter than [Amberite](#amberite). A fist-sized chunk has a [bulk](./core-rules.md#carrying-capacity) of 2. Weapons, shields and armor made from this material are +1 [bulkier](./core-rules.md#carrying-capacity). 

### Arcane Engine
A man-sized device that can channel and direct the power of a [Malevite Orb](#malevite) or [rune](#runes). Can be activated through [rune-using](#rune-using-agiwit). 

Arcane Engines are mostly useful either as siege engines or as stationary constant magic casters. 

### Cerebillium
**Cerebillium** is an odd material, that resembles white marble, with faintly glowing veins of green and turqoise running through it. This material is unique in that it always creates a small magical current on its own, which flows back and forth through the veins. 

These veins tend to grow more numerous over time and to "connect" with each other, forming an intricate web. This process is slow, however. It may take years for any significant change to become noticeable. 

These webs eventually become complex enough to form something of a "consciousness". Some of the oldest examples of **Cerebillium** slabs are said to have the intelligence of a small child!

When sufficient magic is sent flowing through it, the veins glow strongly and change shape, following the current. This can be used to alter the "brain". Alternate methods of altering the brain include scratching out veins, trimming the slab or - most difficult - "teaching". This process is difficult, as the **Cerebillium** consciousness is rarely advanced enough to understand morals or other subtle implications. Direct commands may work, but that depends on the density of the web. 

The veins do not spread to other materials. Only the bright marble-like substance seems to find their favor. Thus, cultivating greater amounts of **Cerebillium** is very difficult and requires synthesization of a very unique chemical compound, which is then left to crystallize over a long time. 

### Runes
Shards of [Abyssalite](#abyssalite) can be carved into **runes**, which allow magic to flow through them in particular ways. Mechanically, they allow the casting of a particular spell of one of the [schools of magic](#list-of-magic-schools), at a constant [Spell Intensity](#spell-intensity-si). 

To activate such a **rune**, is a difficult skill to learn, however. The **rune** must be touched in the right spots, at the right intervals, to activate successfully. Mistakes in this procedure can have disastrous results. 

It also takes great skill to carve **runes**, as each **rune's** shape and complexity depends in part on the size and shape of the [Abyssalite](#abyssalite) shard. The only way to get it right, is to *feel* the way the **rune** must be shaped. Alternatively, the shard can be adjusted to be of equivalent size and shape as another **rune**, but this requires considerable effort, as [Abyssalite](#abyssalite) is a brittle material, prone to shattering if too much force is applied. Thus, it must be carefully filed down to size. This would double the time it takes to [craft](#rune-smithing-arcwit) the **rune**.

Due to how **runes** are always magically charged, they cannot be in the vicinity of any other **runes**. This works a bit like how magnets with the same polarity repulse each other, but a lot more dangerous. This condition applies regardless of the type of magic each of the **runes** hold. If two **runes** are brought to a distance of `60'/20m` or less to each other, they begin to glow, hum and rumble, as if to warn their bearers. Should they be brought to a distance of `45'/15m` or less to each other, they both discharge the magic they hold and repulse each other. This means anyone immediately nearby suffers `3D6` **Bludgeoning** damage. The **runes** are flung away from each other far enough to be at least `63'/21m` apart. *Also*, the **runes** may be **destroyed** in the process. Roll a `D6` for each of the **runes** - if the result is a `1` or `2`, the **rune** is **destroyed**! 

It may be possible to circumvent this repulsion behavior by placing the **runes** in a container made of [Ambersteel](#ambersteel). This requires the container to be of a [quality](./core-rules.md#crafting) level equal to the highest of the **runes'** [Spell Intensity](#spell-intensity-si).

In order to craft a **rune**:
* A **rune** can only be made to cast one type of magic. So the carver has to pick one of the [magic schools](#list-of-magic-schools). 
* The maximum **level** at which a **rune** can be created, depends on the carver's skill. The **level** of the **rune** dictates the level of the respective magic it will cast at. 
* The carver has to succeed a [rune smithing](#rune-smithing-arcwit) skill test. 
* Then, the **rune** must be "primed" by a mage. This requires a **complete success** of a test of the same [school of magic](#list-of-magic-schools) as the **rune** holds, with **Ob** equal to the [Spell Intensity](#spell-intensity-si) of the **rune**. 
* If any of the tests are not a **complete success**, the **rune** is botched and the material cannot be used for another attempt. There is no room for mistakes. 

In order to invoke a **rune**:
* A **complete success** of a [rune-using](#rune-using-agiwit) skill test will invoke the spell of the **rune** as expected. This costs `2` AP in combat. 
* A **partial success** or **complete failure** results in a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire). 
* The user accumulates one third (rounded down, but to no less than `1`) of the rune's [Spell Intensity](#spell-intensity-si) as [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag). 

### Magic Scrolls
**Magic scrolls** allow a single, specific spell to be cast by both mages and non-mages. Once used, the **magic scroll** burns up from the flow of magic and cannot be used again (even if the bearer material is fire-proof). Thus, these are single-use tools. 

Due to how **magic scrolls** are always magically charged, they cannot be in the vicinity of any other **magic scrolls**. This works a bit like how magnets with the same polarity repulse each other, but a lot more dangerous. This condition applies *only* to **magic scrolls** of **same the type of magic**. 

If two **magic scrolls** **of the same type** are brought to a distance of `60'/20m` or less to each other, they begin to glow, hum and rumble, as if to warn their bearers. Should they be brought to a distance of `45'/15m` or less to each other, they both discharge the magic they hold and repulse each other. This means anyone immediately nearby suffers `3D6` **Bludgeoning** damage. The **magic scrolls** are destroyed in the process! 

It may be possible to circumvent this repulsion behavior by placing the **magic scrolls** in a container made of [Ambersteel](#ambersteel). This requires the container to be of a [quality](./core-rules.md#crafting) level equal to the highest of the **magic scrolls'** [Spell Intensity](#spell-intensity-si).

In order to create a **magic scroll**:
* Powdered [Abyssalite](#abyssalite) must be painted onto the parchment, paper or other such material, in a shape specific to the magic spell the **magic scroll** will be able to cast. 
  * This requires a **complete success** of an [artistry](./core-rules.md#artistry-agiawar) or [artificing](#artificing-arcwit) test, at **Ob** equal to the intended [Spell Intensity](#spell-intensity-si) of the **magic scroll**. 
* Then, the **magic scroll** must be "primed" by a mage. This requires a **complete success** of a test of the same [school of magic](#list-of-magic-schools) as the **magic scroll** holds, with **Ob** equal to the [Spell Intensity](#spell-intensity-si) of the **magic scroll**. 
* If any of the tests are not a **complete success**, the **magic scroll** is botched and the material cannot be used for another attempt. There is no room for mistakes. 

In order to invoke a **magic scroll**:
* One must unfurl and hold it plainly in the direction the spell is to be cast, then trace the painted symbol on the **magic scroll** to "agitate" the primed magic. This costs `2` AP in combat. 
* This causes no [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat), but the **magic scroll** is immediately destroyed upon use. It burns up magically (even if the material itself is fire-proof). 

### Malevite
Also known as blood jewel, Malevite is an entirely artificial material, made from the blood of mages, by use of great pressure, a constant arcanic charge and much patience. The more blood it is infused with, the purer the color and more powerful the artifact. 

A blood jewel is a perfectly smooth sphere, with coloration ranging from a foggy and muddy black, to a swirly crimson or at its purest, to a radiant crimson.

Once formed, a Malevite orb can not be infused further. It rejects any more mage blood. 

Destroying such an artifact is not an easy feat. It requires a spike of pure [Ambersteel](#ambersteel) driven through it with great force. Doing so *may* tear a temporary hole in the fabric of reality. 

A Malevite orb is an artifact of very great power that can change the laws of physics and warp reality around it. To direct this power, requires an arcane apparatus, wherein the orb functions like a super-charged battery. To build such a device require a deep understanding of the arcane. When destroyed, the Malevite Orb de-compresses, releasing the blood it was made from in a spectacular hurricane of crimson. 

There are four quality levels. Impure Malevite has side-effects and is not nearly as powerful as a purer blood jewel. 

| Quality | Description | Side-Effects |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Foggy   | Contains a single spell, at `SI 10`, which can only be controlled with an [Arcane Engine](#arcane-engine). | 3 |
| Murky   | Contains up to two spells, at `SI 30`, which can only be controlled with an [Arcane Engine](#arcane-engine). | 2 |
| Swirly  | Contains a weak reality-altering power, which can only be controlled with an [Arcane Engine](#arcane-engine). Can be almost anything, within reason. Things such as a low gravity field, anti-magic field, constant fog-emitter, elemental spewer and similar. | 1 |
| Pure    | Contains a reality-altering power. Practically anything is possible. The crowning achievement the power hungry and the insane. The closest you can get to god-hood. Requires no [Arcane Engine](#arcane-engine). It has transcended the need for such a paltry shackle. | 0 |

#### Malevite Side-Effects

All of the following is kept vague, because it would be hard to list all possible combinations in a way that makes sense while remaining concise. See the following as inspiration for the **GM**, who will finalize the side-effects.

## Memorum
A unique material, grown by a very specific family of fungus that thrives only in the deepest recesses of the world. 

It has found practical use as a means of preserving the immaterial - thoughts, emotions, [magic echoes](#magic-echoes) and even raw knowledge. 

# Assets

## Weapon Properties
Weapon type assets can have the following **properties**:
* **Ambersteel-Lined**: Bonus damage against mages and magical creatures: **+1** for every quality level. **+1D4** for every two **quality levels**, starting at level 1.

# Appendix
The appendix contains important and less important lists, for reference only when needed. 

## Character Creation
Character creation is now supplemented by step `9` - [Determine Arcane Overheat thresholds](#arcane-overheat). 

The new procedure of creating a character consists of the following steps:
1. [Determine life path](./core-rules.md#determine-life-path). 
2. [Determine species, sex & appearance](./core-rules.md#species-sex--appearance).
3. [Determine name](./core-rules.md#determine-name).
4. [Determine abilities](./core-rules.md#determine-abilities).
6. [Determine **carrying capacity** and **assets**](./core-rules.md#determine-assets).
7. [Determine **Max HP** and **Injury Maximum**](./core-rules.md#determine-max-hp--injury-maximum)
8. [Determine exhaustion limit](./core-rules.md#determine-exhaustion-threshold).
9. [Determine Arcane Overheat thresholds](#determine-magic-overheat-thresholds).

### Determine Abilities
Supplements to abilities in character creation. 

#### Choosing Attributes
There are two methods for determining your character's attributes: manual and semi-random. 

You'll have to decide on whether your character will be a mage or not. Mages have the new, 6th attribute to spend points on, so this decision can affect your character's initial overall competence. 

Please keep in mind the values here are representative for an ordinary human about to enter an adventuring life. Other species may have modifiers on their attributes, making them better or worse in some of them. But that depends on the world your **GM** is running. 

This section replaces its core rule counter-part. 

##### Manual Attribute Assignment
* You can spend **9 points** on your attributes. 
* All attributes **except arcana** start at level `1`. Arcana starts at `0`. 
* Your attribute-total cannot be greater than **14**.
* No attribute may have a level less than `1` (except **arcana**) nor higher than `4` (including **arcana**).
* Only one attribute may have a level of `4`. 

##### Semi-Random Attribute Assignment
1. Decide if you want to play a mage.
   1. As a mage, roll **6 D4** and **include** **arcana** in the following steps. 
   2. As a non-mage, roll **5 D4** and **exclude** **arcana** in the following steps. 
2. Row up your dice to form a line, then read them from one end to the other and note each value. The order in which they are written down, is the order in which they'll be applied to the attributes. 
3. If there is more than one `4`, start lowering their value by one, starting from the left or the right, until there is only one `4` left. 
4. Count up the total of your values. 
   1. Subtract your total from **14**.
   2. If the number is negative, that's the number of levels you'll have to go down. <br>
   If the number is positive, that's the number of levels you'll have to go up. 
5. Starting from the left or right, start adjusting each value.
   1. If your levels have to go down, subtract one from each value. **But** skip `1`s. 
   2. If your levels have to go up, add one to each value. **But** skip `4`s. 
6. Repeat from the step of counting up your total and adjusting as necessary, until no more adjustments are necessary. 
7. Lastly, apply the adjusted values to your attributes. 

#### Choosing Skills
If playing a **mage**, keep in mind you need to have at least level 1 in a [magic school skill](#magic-school--school---attribute-) to be able to cast magic. You are also advised to have your strongest magic be at least level 3 or 4, to be able to reliably use it. 

### Determine Arcane Overheat Thresholds
Determine your character's [Arcane Overheat thresholds](#arcane-overheat). 

## List of Assets
The following list does not and cannot aim to be a complete listing of all possible assets in game. Adding new assets as necessary will have to be done by the **GM**. 

### Armor

#### Armor Properties
Armor can have the following **properties**:
* **Ambersteel-Lined**: Bonus protection against magic. `+1` **Ob** for the attacker and reduces magic damage by `+1D4` for every quality level. 
* **Ambersteel-Plated**: Bonus protection against magic. `+1` **Ob** for the attacker and reduces magic damage by `+1D6` for every quality level. 
* **Ambersteel-Forged**: Bonus protection against magic. `+2` **Ob** for the attacker and reduces magic damage by `+1D8` for every quality level. 

> An **Ambersteel**-lined armor at quality level 3 would make magic attacks `+3` **Ob** harder for the attacker and reduces incoming magical damage by `3D4`. 

#### Light Armor
A set of light armor that doesn't impede the wearer much. Example: cloth armor like a gambeson. Might also be leather armor, if the leather comes from a creature whose skin is particularly tough and well suited to being used as armor. 

* Bulk: 2

#### Medium Armor
A set of medium armor with a good balance of protection and weight. Example: full chain mail armor, with or without a helmet. 

* Bulk: 3
* `+1` permanent [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion) while worn. 
* `-1` to [stealth](./core-rules.md#stealth-agiawar) while worn. 
* `-1D` to any defense tests while worn.

#### Heavy Armor
A set of heavy armor with excellent protection, at the cost of encumbering the wearer greatly. Example: full plate armor. 

* Bulk: 4
* `+2` permanent [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion) while worn. 
* `-3` to [stealth](./core-rules.md#stealth-agiawar) while worn. 
* `-2D` to any defense tests while worn. 

| Protections          | Unthreatened | Flanked | Surrounded | Overwhelmed | 
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------- | ---------- | ----------- | 
| **Slashing**         | 15           | 8       | 4          | 0           |

| **Electrical**       | 12           | 6       | 3          | 0           | 

### Shield Types
Shields are items that provide passive bonuses to defense against melee and ranged attacks and require one free hand to use. This implies they cannot be used at the same time as a two-handed weapon (unless of course if you have more than two arms). 

Shields can only be used in defense tests via the [shield](core-rules.md#shield-strtough) skill.

##### Light Shield
A small round or oblong shield commonly held as far from the body as possible, to deflect small or stabbing weapons with ease. Helps only little against heavy blows and don't expect to deflect arrows with this, either. 

* Bulk: 1

| Unthreatened           | Flanked           | Surrounded           | Overwhelmed           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| `+1` [compensation point](core-rules.md#compensation-points) for melee defense. | `+1D` for melee defense. | / | / |
| `+2` [compensation points](core-rules.md#compensation-points) for melee defense against **stabbing** attacks. | `+2D` for melee defense against **stabbing** attacks. | `+1D` for melee defense against **stabbing** attacks. | / |
| `-1D` for ranged defense. | `-2D` for ranged defense. | `-2D` for ranged defense. | `-2D` for ranged defense. |

##### Medium Shield
A medium-sized, round or kite-shaped shield made from tough wood and leather or even metal, which offers good protection against most attacks, while not encumbering the wielder too much. 

* Bulk: 2
* `+1` permanent [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion) while wielded. 

| Unthreatened           | Flanked           | Surrounded           | Overwhelmed           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| `+1` [compensation point](core-rules.md#compensation-points) for any defense. | `+1D` for any defense. | / | `-1D` for any defense. |

##### Heavy Shield
A large, kite-shaped or rectangular shield, which can protect every part of the fighter, from the shoulder down to the feet. Its weight is very tiring. 

* Bulk: 4
* `+2` permanent [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion) while wielded. 

| Unthreatened           | Flanked           | Surrounded           | Overwhelmed           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| `+2` [compensation points](core-rules.md#compensation-points) for any defense. | `+1` [compensation point](core-rules.md#compensation-points) for any defense. | `+1D` for any defense. | / |

### List of General Assets
In the following table, `Q` refers to the quality grade of the asset. See also the [crafting](./core-rules.md#crafting) rules. When in a hurry (as a **GM**), substitute the `Q` with `3`.

| Name                     | Bulk | Max. Stack Size | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Acid Bomb                | 1    | 3               | A small fragile shell with two compartments, filled with two liquids which, when they combine, act as a powerful acid. When shattered, deals `QD6 Acid` damage to whatever it hits. |
| Blackpowder Bomb         | 1    | 2               | A small iron-shelled bomb, filled with blackpowder. A short fuse sticks out and must be lit to set it off. Once lit, the bomb will detonate after 3 turns or 15 seconds. Deals `QD4 Bludgeoning + QD4 Burning` damage to anyone in a `6'/2m` radius. |
| Calming Tea              | 1    | 3               | This herbal tea has the ability to calm nerves. Removes [berserk](./core-rules.md#berserk), [jealous](./core-rules.md#jealous) and [terrified](./core-rules.md#terrified). Best enjoyed steaming hot, but not necessarily. |
| Dragon's Breath Potion   | 1    | 3               | Upon drinking this potion, the orange liquid combines with the stomach acid and bursts out of the drinker's throat, igniting and thus causing them to spew fire! Causes `1D8 - Q Burning` damage to the user and `QD6 Burning` damage in a `18'/6m` cone in front of the user. |
| Death Fog                | 1    | 1               | An extremely rare and deadly gas. Once exposed to air, covers an area of `Q*6'/Q*2m` in impenetrable, eerily glowing, blue fog. Deals `6D10 + 40` **pure** damage to all **organic** things it touches, per tick. Metal and mineral are unaffected, while plant and flesh are struck from existence. |
| Fire Pot (Potion)        | 1    | 3               | An ancient recipe, this concoction bursts into flame when exposed to air for several seconds. It causes severe burns for `QD6 Burning` damage in a `6'/2m` radius. Consumed on use. |
| Illusionist's Powder     | 1    | 2               | A small amount of weakly iridescently shimmering powder. When scattered, the dust remains suspended in mid-air and settles in an image of the making alchemist's choosing, which at a distance can seem perfectly real. It takes a successful test at `Ob Q + 1` to see through the ruse. This image lasts `QD10` minutes. |
| Invigorating Potion      | 1    | 3               | The drinker of this potion feels refreshed and invigorated! Reduces exhaustion by `Q` and clears the [exhausted](./core-rules.md#exhausted) condition. Beware this potion can only be safely imbibed twice in a 24 hour cycle. If drunk more, roll a `D6`. If it is a **hit**, you're in luck! But if not, you instead suffer `+2` points of [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion). |
| Laudanum Potion          | 1    | 2               | This wonderous substance can quell pain and calm nerves within seconds. Also effective against diarrhea. Upon imbibing, sets one **active** [injury](./core-rules.md#injury) to **treated**. After 24 hours, the [injury](./core-rules.md#injury) is set back to **active**, even if it was also properly **treated** in the meantime. Also, must succeed a [self-control](./core-rules.md#self-control-toughtough) test at `Ob 3`, or else become [addicted](./core-rules.md#drug-addicted) to the stuff. |
| Love Potion              | 1    | 2               | Anyone drinking this potion will become virtually irresistible to anyone close enough to smell their air. Victims have to succeed a [self-control](./core-rules.md#self-control-toughtough) test at `Ob Q` or else feel **very strongly compelled** to fulfill the user's every wish and desire (provided this wouldn't obviously cause harm to the victim). |
| Magic Recorder           | 1    | 3               | A small spherical device, overtly made from various metals with intricate patterns on its surface. This device can capture [Magic Echoes](#magic-echoes) and record magic as it is being cast. Also captures fragments of thoughts from its bearer while it is active. |
| Night-Eye Potion         | 1    | 3               | Grants the ability to see reasonably well under low-light conditions, up to `Q * 10'/3m` around them, for an hour. Beware that under the influence of this potion, exposure to bright light is extremely difficult to endure and will cause `+1` [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion) for every **minute** of exposure. |
| Paralyzing Poison        | 1    | 2               | Causes a victim's muscles to seize up. They suffer `-1 AP` each turn and are forced to move sluggishly. If this poison is suffered twice, the victim seizes up completely and is unable to move. This poison can be resisted once upon suffering it, with [toughness](./core-rules.md#toughness-tough), at `Ob Q`. If unsuccessful, the effect will last an hour. |
| Poison Resistance Potion | 1    | 2               | Once imbibed, halves all incurred poison damage, for up to `Q` hours. |
| Sleeping Poison          | 1    | 3               | Causes a victim to feel incredibly sleepy. Unless they succeed a [self-control](./core-rules.md#self-control-toughtough) test at `Ob Q`, they will fall asleep the first chance they get. They cannot be woken from this state for at least `6` hours. |
| Smoke Bomb               | 1    | 3               | A small fragile shell, filled with a very fine powder which when broken causes an area in a `Q * 3'/1m` radius to be covered in smoke. It is impossible to see through and ranged attacks within or through the smoke-covered area suffer `+2` **Ob**. Victims caught in the smoke may be forced to cough. The smoke lasts `6` turns or `30` seconds. |
| Throwing Blade           | 1    | 6               | A small weighted blade, like a knife or star, well suited to being thrown. Can be used in melee and acts like a [dagger](#dagger-agiawar), but with a penalty of `-2D` to attack and defense. `+1D` when [thrown](./core-rules.md#throwing-accuracy) for a ranged attack. Deals `2D4 + Str piercing` damage. |

### Weapon Types
Following are fantasy-themed weapon types. 

For ranged weapons there is note made of a value called the "distance increment". This describes the distance within which the weapon can be used optimally, for no penalty to **Ob** and damage. As soon as a shooter wants to hit a target past their initial (= optimal) distance increment, they incur a penalty as noted on the attack in question. This penalty is multiplied by every increment past the initial. 

> For example, when a distance increment of 30'/10m has been noted, then shooting anything within and up to that distance incurs no penalties. But as soon as the shooter wants to hit something at 33'/11m distance, they incur their first penalty. The next penalty is incurred at 63'/21m and so on. 

#### Dagger (Agi/Awar)
Any very short, one-handed blade. Examples: shiv, dagger, rondel-dagger

For all attacks made with a dagger, the following rules apply:
* If the target is unaware or [grappled](./core-rules.md#grappled), then the target's armor does **not** reduce the dagger's damage.
* `-1 Ob` against [proned](./core-rules.md#prone) and/or [grappled](./core-rules.md#grappled) targets.

## List of Magic Schools
The capabilities of the various magic schools are described by the [expertise](./core-rules.md#expertise) associated with each of them. The concrete effects are kept vague on purpose, to allow a certain freedom when choosing how the magic is expressed. But the intensity or strength of a casting is tied to the level of the [magic school skill](#magic-school--school---attribute-). 

The levels noted for each magic school represent the effects a mage can achieve, when casting that particular type of magic. Stronger effects generally require a higher level. 

See also [testing magic](#testing-magic). 

In all the following tables, note the following:
* Replace *SI* with the chosen [spell intensity](#spell-intensity-si). 
* *Level* is the prerequisite level of the **magic school skill**, at which a given spell becomes available for use. 
* Whenever distances and radii are concerned, a mage may always choose a *shorter* distance or radius. For example, a `SI * 6'/2m` radius definition, sets the **maximum**. The radius may be at most this large, but can be smaller, if the mage so chooses. 
* Whenever the effect is unleashed in a **cone**, then at every point it has traveled, it is as wide as far as it has traveled. So for example, at 3'/1m distance, it is 3'/1m wide. At 9'/3m distance, it is 9'/3m wide. 

### Aeromancy (Arc/Agi)
The control of air, to create and change its flow, for benefit and detriment. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance    | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |
| ----- | -------------------- | -- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 0     | Wind Tunnel          | 2  | SI * 9'/3m  | SI                           | Conjures up an unnatural stream of air that speeds the step of all creatures moving in its direction and slowing down all creatures that move in the opposite direction, by `6'/2m`. This gust originates from the caster lasts 3 turns. Can clear away gases and the like. | The caster loses control and is tossed `15'/5m` in a random direction! |
| 0     | Wind Lance           | 2  | SI * 9'/3m  | Opposed                      | Hurls a directed, compacted bolt of air towards a victim, dealing `1D10 + SI` **bludgeoning** damage. Upon impact, creates a loud whipping noise. | The attack is launched in a random direction, instead. |
| 0     | Breathing Bubble     | 2  | 3'/1m       | SI                           | **Concentration**: Form a stationary bubble of clean air, up to `SI * 3'/1m` large in diameter, that will last for as long as you concentrate on it. | The caster loses control and is tossed `15'/5m` in a random direction! |
| 2     | Updraft              | 1  | 3'/1m       | SI                           | Create a gust of wind to help you reach greater heights, by jumping or flying up to `SI * 6'/2m` higher. | The effect is instead the inverse, pushing down on you and forcing you [prone](./core-rules.md#prone). |
| 2     | Vacuumize            | 2  | 24'/8m      | SI                           | **Concentration**: Drive all air out of a stationary area of choice, within *distance*, up to `SI * 3'/1m` large in diameter. All creatures caught in the anti-air bubble start suffocating, as all air is driven from their lungs, as well. | The air around the caster is displaced, instead of the spot of their choosing. |
| 5     | Tornado              | 2  | SI * 18'/6m | SI                           | **Concentration**: Call forth a tornado and control its movements. It is up to `SI * 3'/1m` wide and tall, and can displace creatures and objects up to `SI * 2` bulk, throwing them up to `SI * 6'/2m` far. Upon landing and impacting with a surface, victims suffer `SI D6` points of bludgeoning damage. The tornado can clear away gases and the like. | The air compresses around the caster, crushing them for `SI D6 + SI` points of bludgeoning damage. |
| 5     | Crushing Compression | 2  | SI * 18'/6m | SI                           | Compress the air around a victim, crushing them for `SI D6` points of bludgeoning damage. | The air compresses around the caster instead, crushing them for `SI D6 + SI` points of bludgeoning damage. |

The setting of arcane traps and creation of arcane artifacts and materials. 

[Crafting](./core-rules.md#crafting)
| Product                              | Complexity | Workload  | Ob         | Materials                              | Quality Bonus   |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------- | 
| Imbued Object - works just like "Place Arcane Charge" | High | Moderate | / | An object to "enchant".                | / |
| [Arcane Engine](#arcane-engine)      | Very High  | High      | 3          | 3 bulk of [Abyssalite](#abyssalite); A sturdy frame-material, like steel. | -1 side-effect for [Malevite Orbs](#malevite). |
| [Malevite Orb](#malevite)            | Very High  | Very High | purity * 5 | A lot of Mage blood; 3 or 9 or 27 or 81 bulk of [Abyssalite](#abyssalite) (graded per purity level) | / |

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |
| ----- | -------------------- | -- | -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 0     | Place Arcane Charge  | 3  | 3'/1m    | SI                           | Concentrate arcane energy on a point in hand's reach. The surface begins to glow and feels receptive. Any other spell that is then cast at the same spot, charges the arcane charge. A trigger defined by the mage will then unleash the stored spell. Note only simple triggers are possible. The charge cannot make distinctions like friend or foe. Example triggers: on touch, on detection of movement in front of the charge, on detection of sound, on the utterance of a specific word. The arcane charge lasts `SI D4` hours. After that, it harmlessly dissipates. The charge is stationary. It cannot be moved. For every `3 SI`, the spell it holds may be `+1 SI` stronger. | The arcane charge becomes unstable. Roll a `D4` to determine in what way. On a 1: the stored spell loses half its `SI` in strength. 2: the charge triggers in `1D6` minutes. 3: the charge immediately dissipates. 4: the stored spell is overriden. Instead, upon triggering, the charge now emits an excruciatingly loud noise. |
| 0     | Imitate Arcane Echo  | 2  | 30'/10m  | Imitated spell's SI, divided by 2 and rounded up | Draw from a [magic echo](#magic-echoes) located up to `30'/10m` away and re-new it, casting it again at the SI it once had when it was originally cast. | The caster suffers the full back-fire of the spell that was imitated. |
| 1     | Elemental Shield     | 2  | 3'/1m    | SI                           | **Concentration**: Arcane energy envelops your skin, to counter one specific element of your choosing. You or a **ST** of your choice, within hand's reach, suffer `SI * 2` less damage of that element's type of damage. Available elements are: [Acid, Bleeding, Burning, Electrical, Freezing, Poison](./core-rules.md#damage-types). | You instead become twice as vulnerable to the element you chose, causing you to take twice as much damage! This effect lasts 3 turns, or 15 seconds. |
| 1     | Slag Bomb            | 2  | 18'/6m + SI * 3'/1m | SI                | Cause `+SI` [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) to all targets within a `9'/3m` radius at a spot of your choosing. | Instead of the intended spot, the Slag Bomb detonates right in your face. |
| 1     | Detonate Slag        | 2  | 18'/6m + SI * 3'/1m | SI                | Remove `SI` points of [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) from a **ST**, within reach and cause them to explode with arcane energy, dealing `N D4` points of pure damage, where *N* is the number of [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) points that were removed. | Instead of the intended target, your own [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) detonates! |

### Alteration (Arc/Wit)
The alteration of physical things, to change their shape and purpose. 

Note that altering the shape of creatures poses a particular challenge. Unless if the test is a **complete success**, the target creature may mutate, horribly. When failing a test, consult the [list of mutations](./core-rules.md#list-of-mutations), to determine the type of mutation. 

Creatures can resist the change with [toughness](./core-rules.md#toughness-tough). Inanimate objects don't resist. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |
| ----- | -------------------- | -- | -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 0     | Alter Shape          | 3  | 3'/1m    | Opposed + SI                 | A **ST** (object or creature) is altered as the mage desires. The complexity and size of the re-shaping depends on the **SI**. 1-3 are for simple and small, 4-6 for tricky and medium, 7-8 for complex and large and 9+ for very complex and very large alterations. Consult your **GM**! | The intended alteration occurs only on the caster. |

### Cryomancy (Arc/Arc)
The summoning and control of ice. Cryomancer's can freeze things, so they're heavier and harder to break. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance    | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |
| ----- | -------------------- | -- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 0     | Freezing Touch       | 2  | 3'/1m       | Opposed - SI                 | A fist-sized spot on a **ST**, that the mage's hand touches, freezes over and deals `SI` **freezing** damage. | The caster is affected, instead. |
| 1     | Cold Finger Gun      | 2  | SI * 15'/5m | Opposed                      | The mage shoots an ice spike at a **ST** from their hand, dealing `1D10 + SI` **freezing** damage. Causes +1 [frostbitten](./core-rules.md#frostbitten). | The caster is affected, instead. |
| 3     | Deep Freeze          | 3  | 3'/1m       | Opposed                      | A man-sized area of whatever the mage's hand is touching freezes over. The frost even penetrates and runs deep in a **ST**, dealing `SI D4` **freezing** damage. Causes +1 [frostbitten](./core-rules.md#frostbitten). | The caster is affected, instead. |
| 5     | Rooting Freeze       | 3  | SI * 15'/5m | 5                            | A spot of the mage's choosing freezes over. Anyone caught within the **AOE** `SI * 6'/2m` radius, will be frozen to the spot and thus [rooted](./core-rules.md#rooted) and also suffer `SI D4` **Freezing** damage. They can break free via a successful [strength](./core-rules.md#strength-str) test at **Ob 3**. Or wait, until the ice thaws, which under normal conditions will be 3 turns. | The spot beneath the caster is affected, instead. |

### Electromancy (Agi/Arc)
The summoning and control of lightning. Electricity is fairly versatile - it can injure or stun and power or trigger electrical and electronic devices. 

| Level | Name                  | AP | Distance     | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |
| ----- | --------------------- | -- | ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 0     | Shocking Touch        | 2  | 3'/1m        | Opposed - SI                 | A small area, about the size of the mage's hand is burned on touch by an electrical shock, dealing `SI` **electrical** damage to a **ST**. | The caster is affected, instead. |
| 1     | Shock                 | 2  | SI * 9'/3m   | Opposed                      | An arc of lightning strikes the vulnerable internals of a **ST**, dealing `SI D4` **electrical** damage. | The caster is affected, instead. |
| 1     | Power-Up              | 2  | SI * 3'/1m   | SI                           | An electrical device is powered up for `SI * 5` minutes. | The device breaks or otherwise seizes up and becomes unusable. |
| 2     | Stunning Shock        | 2  | SI * 15'/5m  | Opposed - SI                 | An aimed arc of lightning strikes a **ST** and adds one stack of [stunned](./core-rules.md#stunned). | The caster is affected, instead. |

| 5     | Mass Stunning Shock   | 3  | SI * 30'/10m | Opposed                      | Several arcs of aimed lightning spew forth from the mage's finger tips, striking up to `SI + 1` **MST** and adding 3 stacks of [stunned](./core-rules.md#stunned). | The caster and anyone next to them is affected, instead. |

### Hexing (Arc/Arc)
The casting of curses to weaken others. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance     | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |

They lose `SI` points of [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag), which convert into `N D6` points of acid damage, where *N* is the number of [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag) points removed! | The caster suffers the effect, instead! |

### Hydromancy (Agi/Arc)
The control of directly accessible water. Blood and creatures cannot be affected by this school. 

Contact with **magically fouled water** will always cause [illness](./core-rules.md#illness)! Fortunately, fouled water does not mix with pure water. But it also cannot be purified - it is, under normal circumstances, **irreversibly** fouled! 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance     | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |

### Illusion (Arc/Awar)
Creation of non-physical influences on the senses. That includes images, sounds and odors. The illusions cannot cause direct harm, although they can drive an individual to acts that may put them in danger. 

A victim reaching their [exhaustion limit](./core-rules.md#exhaustion) by effect of this magic, while [terrified](./core-rules.md#terrified), must succeed a [toughness](./core-rules.md#toughness-tough) test, or else suffer a heart-attack and **die** outright. The **Ob** is a third of the **attribute**, rounded up. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance     | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |

The intensity of the illusion is determined by the **SI**. 1 for a weak and small, 2 for a moderate and 3-4 for a large and intense, 5-6 for a giant and 7+ for a titanic illusion. *Can* be used to inflict [terror](./core-rules.md#terrified) or intense [jealousy](./core-rules.md#jealous). The victim suffers +1 [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion). | The caster suffers +1 [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion). |

### Psionics (Arc/Wit)
Mind over matter! Psionics grants powerful abilities to manipulate objects, influence others and even wield magic as a weapon or shield. 

* Obvious: A purple flame lights within the mage's eyes, when they use their psionic abilities.
* [Prerequisites](./core-rules.md#specialization-skills): [Telepathy](#telepathy-arcwit) (3), [telekinesis](#telekinesis-arcagi) (3)

Only targets within and up to the given *distance* can be moved and only within and up to that *distance* from the mage. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance     | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |

| 0     | Psionic Missile      | 2  | SI * 15'/5m  | Opposed                      | Using psionics, extend the force of a punch, to hurl a focused psionic shockwave towards a **ST**, dealing `SI D6` **bludgeoning** damage. | The caster is affected, instead. |
| 1     | Psionic Shield       | 2  | SI * 9'/3m   | SI                           | As a **reaction** to you or an ally being hit with an attack, cast a shield of psionic energy to erupt around yourself or an ally within distance, which absorbs up to `SI * 10` points of any damage. | Instead of absorbing damage, the target instead suffers an additional `SI * 3` points of **bludgeoning** damage. |
| 1     | Psionic Hasten       | 2  | SI * 36'/18m | 3 + SI                       | **Concentration**: [Hasten](./core-rules.md#hasted) up to `SI` creatures of choice. | The caster suffers +1 [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion). |

### Pyromancy (Arc/Arc)
The summoning and control of fire. The flame being a destructive force, pyromancers enjoy little utility from their magic, beyond the ability to create light and heat. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance     | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |

| 7     | Flame Jet            | 3  | SI * 30'/10m | SI + 1                       | A steady stream of flame shoots from the mage's hands, dealing `SI D6` **burning** damage and inflicting +2 [burning](./core-rules.md#burning) to anything caught by it, in a straight **AOE** line.  | The line of fire erupts backwards, through the mage. They and anyone behind them, in the line's range is affected. |
| 9     | Rain of Fire         | 4  | SI * 60'/20m | SI + 3                       | The mage makes fire rain from the sky. A ball of fire falls from the sky for every `SI`, dealing `6D6 + SI` **burning** damage and inflicting +2 [burning](./core-rules.md#burning) in a **AOE** `24'/8m` radius, at a location of choice. | No fire falls from the sky, instead the SI number of fire balls erupt in the mage's hands. They and anyone in the radius suffers the damage. |

### Restoration (Arc/Awar)
The mending of [injuries](./core-rules.md#injury) and treatment of [diseases](./core-rules.md#illness). 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance | Ob                              | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |

It may still leave a [scar](./core-rules.md#scar). Also restores `SI D10` missing [HP](./core-rules.md#hit-points-hp). Only one such treatment can safely be made, per creature, every `6` hours. If a treatment is made within that time, roll a `D6` - a `1` or `2` will cause the patient to suffer a mutation, while a `3` through `5` will cause them `+2` [Arcane Slag](#arcane-slag). | The caster suffers `SI D10` points of [bleeding](./core-rules.md#damage-types) damage. |

### Sanguinomancy (Arc/Tough)
In the common tongue, blood magic, utilizes mage blood to control a deeply unsettling power. The used blood must be fresh, although not necessarily from the caster.

This spell causes `SI` less [Arcane Overheat](#arcane-overheat) (down to at most `1`). Arcanically charge the blood and smear it on something (like a weapon). The blood begins to boil, causing it to deal `SI D4` [burning](./core-rules.md#damage-types) damage to the touch.

### Soul-Binding (Arc/Tough)
Also referred to as **necromancy**, this is the art and skill of calling souls from the **plane of the dead** and binding them, to reanimate corpses or animate an otherwise unliving body. 

In order to bind a soul, a **soul-seal** is required. This seal has to take the form of a pentagram. The medium doesn't matter, although if the seal is destroyed, the soul binding is broken. So, if a mage wants to create a lasting soul-binding, an enduring medium for the seal is advisable. 

A mage can only ever issue commands to a soul that they've bound. It is not possible to command souls bound by other mages. 

A **soul-binding** can be broken, but it in order to do so, a **soul-binding** test at **Ob** equal to the strength of the **soul-binding** must be **completely succeeded**. It is possible to lift a **soul-binding** made by another mage. 

An important note about **completely failing** a **soul-binding** attempt - a **complete failure** results in the spell-backfiring and displacing the mage's soul with the one they were trying to bind. Their soul is essentially evicted from their own body and sent to the **plane of the dead**. The soul they tried to bind then takes over their body. 

Another important note about targeting a specific soul. It is easier to recall the soul that previously inhabited a body, the shorter the time of death has been. However, targeting a specific soul is an immensely difficult undertaking and shouldn't be taken lightly. For every day past the original time of death, the difficulty of recalling the soul increases by **1 Ob**. 

| Level | Name                 | AP | Distance   | Ob                           | Effect(s)                      | Backfire Effect(s) |
| ----- | -------------------- | -- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 0     | Call and Bind a Soul | 3  | 3'/1m      | SI                           | Create a **soul-binding** at the strength of the chosen level. The larger, heavier and more complex a body is, the harder it is to create a binding. Anything larger than, heavier or more complex than a human will make the **soul-binding** harder. 1-3 for a small and simple, 4-5 for a moderate and 6+ for a large and complex binding. Consult your **GM**. Requires a **soul-seal**. Replacing an existing binding is possible, but the test must exceed the original soul-seals strength. | The caster's soul is evicted from their body and another soul takes place. The caster's character is effectively removed from the world. |
| 1     | Command Bound Soul   | 1  | SI * 6'/3m | Opposed by [wit](./core-rules.md#wit-wit) - SI | Issue a single command that the bound soul **must** follow. | +1 [exhaustion](./core-rules.md#exhaustion) to the caster. |

The caster's character is effectively removed from the world. |
| 5     | Call back a Soul     | 3  | 3'/1m      | SI + days since death        | Target a specific soul and recall them into their prior body. This isn't, strictly speaking, the same as binding a soul. | The caster's soul is evicted from their body and another soul takes place. The caster's character is effectively removed from the world. |

### Telekinesis (Arc/Agi)
The ability to affect things and even creatures from afar, using magic instead of muscles or tools. 

When using objects as projectiles, choose the [damage type](./core-rules.md#damage-types) as appropriate. For example, a crossbow bolt might cause **piercing** damage, while a rock might cause **bludgeoning** damage.

The mage can only ever perform *one* movement with a spell cast. So, for example, it is not possible to violently shake things or creatures around, without casting **telekinesis** multiple times, to do so. During combat, every movement takes one turn. Out of combat, about five seconds. A single movement is a displacement from one point to another, in a straight and uninterrupted line. 

Only targets within and up to the given *distance* can be moved and only within and up to that *distance* from the mage.

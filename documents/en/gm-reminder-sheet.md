# Ambersteel - Game-Mastery Reminder Sheet

## The Start of a Session
1. Recap the last session. Preferably, a player should do this.
2. Time for personality and driver changes. 
3. Time for fate-card purchases. Everyone should say out loud what cards they bought. 

## During the Session

### Choosing Ob
Keep in mind that **attribute** tests are much harder to succeed, than **skill** tests. The following guidelines aim to provide a point of orientation:
* For **attribute** tests
  * **Ob** 1 is easy:
  * **Ob** 2-3 is difficult
  * **Ob** 4-6 is challenging
  * **Ob** 7+ is very challenging
* For **skill** tests:
  * **Ob** 1-2 is trivial
  * **Ob** 3-4 is difficult
  * **Ob** 4-6 is challenging
  * **Ob** 7-8 is very challenging
  * **Ob** 9+ is masterful

### Challenge Your Players
1. **Mechanical challenges**
   1. Tests
      1. Present opportunities for **PC**s to *learn*.
      2. Present opportunities for **PC**s to *shine* - ask a test of a specific **PC** and *only* that **PC**. Others may not *test-band-wagon*. 
   2. Combat
      1. Enemies with strengths that counter certain **PC**s, but have other distinct weaknesses.
      2. Environmental hazards (explosive barrels, spider webs, deep pits, a drawbridge, etc.).
   3. Drivers
      1. Regularly present situations that target a **PC**'s **aspirations** or **reaction**s, which *should* get them into *trouble*. 
      2. Occasionally present **PC**s with resources to help them with their **ambition**. 
      3. **Take note** of any fate points that may have been earned. 
   4. Limit access to resources.
2. **Narrative challenges**
   1. Challenge morality, personality and drivers.
   2. Have the world react to actions. Allow world change and encourage world change. Make your players think about the consequences of their actions. 
   3. Threaten things and people dear to the **PC**s.

### Keep Your Players Engaged
1. Preserve **player agency**. Players come up with reactions and solutions - not you. 
2. Give everyone a **chance** to react to a situation.
3. Give everyone a **chance** to propose a plan on how to proceed in a given situation. 
4. Give **fair warning** to your introverted players.
5. Offer rewards and make it clear what those rewards are. Keep timed reward count low. 

## The End of a Session
1. Hand out fate points
   1. Players especially, are encouraged to share what situations the noted, where a PC may have earned their player fate points. 
   2. Also hand out fate points as you see fit. 
2. Gather feedback
    1. What was your favorite moment of today's session?
    2. What was your least favorite moment of today's session?
    3. Was the balance of combat vs. role-play to your liking?
    4. (If there was NPC-interaction) What was your favorite NPC interaction today?

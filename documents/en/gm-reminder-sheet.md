### Challenge Your Players
1. **Mechanical challenges**
   1. Tests
      1. Present opportunities for **PC**s to *learn*.
      2. Present opportunities for **PC**s to *shine* - ask a test of a specific **PC** and *only* that **PC**. Others may not *test-band-wagon*. 
      3. Fewer tests are generally better - re-test only, if the situation has changed.
   2. Combat
      1. Enemies with strengths that counter certain **PC**s.
      2. Enemies with specific weaknesses, that a **PC** can counter.
      3. Environmental hazards (explosive barrels, spider webs, deep pits, a drawbridge, etc.).
   3. Challenge personality.
      1. Regularly present situations that target a **PC**'s **aspirations** or **reaction**s, which *should* get them into *trouble*. 
      2. Regularly, but infrequently, present **PC**s with resources to help them with their **ambition**. 
      3. **Take note** of any fate points that may have been earned. 
   4. Limit access to resources.
2. **Narrative challenges**
   1. Challenge morality.
   2. Have the world react to actions. Allow world change and encourage world change. Make your players think about the consequences of their actions. 
   3. Threaten things and people dear to the **PC**s.
   4. Present places to establish a home-base. Make sure the location is not remote, to allow adventure to actually reach the **PC**s. 

### Keep Your Players Engaged
1. Give everyone a **chance** to react to a situation.
2. Give everyone a **chance** to propose a plan on how to proceed in a given situation. 
3. Give **fair warning** to your introverted players.
4. Preserve **player agency**. Players come up with reactions and solutions - not you. 
5. Offer rewards and make it clear what those rewards are. Keep timed reward count low. 

## The End of a Session
1. Hand out fate points
   1. Players especially, are encouraged to share what situations the noted, where a PC may have earned their player fate points. 
   2. Also hand out fate points as you see fit. 
2. Gather feedback
    1. What was your favorite moment of today's session?
    2. What was your least favorite moment of today's session?
    3. Was the balance of combat vs. role-play to your liking?
    4. (If there was NPC-interaction) What was your favorite NPC interaction today?

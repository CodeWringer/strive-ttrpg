# Ambersteel TTRPG
**Ambersteel** is a table-top role-playing game (**TTRPG**), requiring a **game master** (**GM**) and at least one **player** to play. 

## Core
The [core rules](documents/en/core-rules.md)-document presents the system's core rules that both players and **GM** must know. There is also a reminder/reference sheet: [core-rules reminder sheet](./documents/en/core-rules-reminder-sheet.md)

The [gm-guide](documents/en/gm-guide.md)-document provides guidance and hints solely directed at the **GM**. There is also a reminder/reference sheet: [gm reminder sheet](./documents/en/gm-reminder-sheet.md)

## Modules
Modules extend or alter the core rules, to fit a specific theme or setting. They are designed to be as light-weight as possible and only serve as supplements to the core rules. They can not be used for play on their own. 

Currently officially supported modules are:
* [Medieval fantasy](documents/en/fantasy-rules.md) - Low to medium fantasy in a medieval world.

# STRIVE TTRPG
**STRIVE** is a table-top role-playing game (**TTRPG**), requiring a **game master** (**GM**) and at least one **player** to play. 

## Core
The [STRIVE Core](documents/en/strive-core.md) document contains all the rules that both players and **GM** must know and which form the basis for all play in STRIVE. 

The [STRIVE Game Master's Resource](documents/en/strive-game-masters-resource.md) document provides guidance and hints solely directed at the **GM**. It is entirely optional. 

## Modules
Modules extend or alter the core rules, to fit a specific theme or setting. They are designed to be as light-weight as possible and only serve as supplements to the core rules. They only work in conjunction with the core rules. 

Currently officially supported modules are:
* [STRIVE Fantasy Module](documents/en/strive-fantasy-module.md) - Adds rules suited to a fantasy medieval setting.
